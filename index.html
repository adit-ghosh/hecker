Chapter 1: Author's Note
________________________________________
Just when a writer has a crazy idea and wants to write is the product is the following. Read and Review. Constructive Criticisms appreciated. Also vote for your favorite chapter.
Also if you are overly religious then don't read or you will get triggered! I have taken shots at some religions, so be warned! And also the story will be a bit of slow build so do not expect Naruto or Artemis to meet and fall in love in the first couple of chapters.
Also the characters are NOT MINE they belong to both Kishimoto and Rick Riordan respectively for Naruto and Percy Jackson And The Olympians.
HAPPY READING !

Trailer
In Istanbul Turkey,
At 7 am a black sedan is moving on the road in which there are three passengers, a man and 2 children who looked like they were going to school. At Istanbul Public School's front gate the car suddenly stopped, out of the car came a tall blond man about 6'7", looking in his early-twenties and two children, a boy and a girl. The girl had sun-kissed blond hair with auburn strands of hair in between, had silver eyes shining like the moon while the boy had auburn hair with blond strands and his eyes were that of blue color just like the man behind him. The distinguishable feature about the three of them was the whisker-like marks on their cheek, while both the kids had 2 on each side; the adult had 3 on each side.
"Okay, kids go to school and remember no mischief, okay, be good kids and we will go somewhere special." The blond man said.
"Really?!" The kids asked in excitement.
"Yes, now go Dhriti, Remulus. Bye." The man said to the kids. "Bye dad." Both of them replied.
"Oh hey Nakul, Dropping your kids off." Another man asked , now named Nakul.
"Yeah Benji. Okay then, see you later." Nakul said while leaving
"Bye Nakul" "Bye Benjamin"
Nakul Sachdeva once picked his kids up from the school and then went grocery shopping together after that making dinner and his kids going to bed. He went into the kitchen and opened a small fridge; he took out a beer bottle from there and started to drink it on the table while reminiscing about his wife.
At that moment, while drinking he again went into the cabinet and took out another bottle and opened it and kept it on the table. "You know, you were never good at hiding, god knows how you became a spy master Jiraiya-sama." He said in a whisper. At that moment a man suddenly appeared from the corner of the room.
"You know you hurt me by saying Jiraiya-sama, and I thought my apprentice would finally call me sensei." Jiraiya said in a fake hurt tone
"Well with an irresponsible man who leaves a baby to an old geezer who couldn't do shit to protect him and another man who neglected him, I don't think so." Nakul replied in a cold tone
"Now Naruto…" While Jiraiya was trying to explain to Naruto, in his mind one thing was going on. "Shit! The House has been compromised and has to move. New York! "
"Save your excuses, why are you here? Let me guess, the village wants their precious weapon back. Isn't that right?" Naruto said in a cold tone.
Story coming November 5 2023

________________________________________
In Istanbul Turkey,
At 7 am a black sedan is moving on the road in which there are three passengers, a man and 2 children who looked like they were going to school. At Istanbul Public School's front gate, the car suddenly stopped, out of the car came a tall blond man about 6'7", looking in his early twenties, and two children, a boy, and a girl. The girl had sun-kissed blond hair with auburn strands of hair in between, had silver eyes shining like the moon while the boy had auburn hair with blond strands and his eyes were that of blue color just like the man behind him. The distinguishable feature about the three of them was the whisker-like marks on their cheek, while both the kids had 2 on each side; the adult had 3 on each side.
"Okay, kids go to school and remember no mischief, okay, be good kids and we will go somewhere special." The blond man said.
"Really?!" The kids asked in excitement.
"Yes, now go Dhriti, Vassilis. Bye." The man said to the kids. "Bye Dad." Both of them replied.
"Oh hey, Nakul. Dropping your kids off." Another man asked, now named Nakul.
"Yeah, Benji. Okay then, see you later." Nakul said while leaving
"Bye Nakul" "Bye Benjamin"
As he dropped his kids off at school Nakul Sachdeva went directly to his workplace. Nakul is a hardworking Indian NRI in Turkey, though most people who meet him get thrown off by his blond hair since it's rare to impossible for an Indian to have blonde hair unless it is dyed but Nakul was one of a kind. He works in a software firm as a senior manager, which is remarkable given his age.
As for his family, he is an orphan and has a wife and two kids- Dhriti and Vassilis, Vassilis's name was that due to his mother. Since Nakul married a Greco-American woman named Luna and she gave birth to twins, it was decided that she would name one kid while he would name the other. In all, he had a happy family even though sometimes his wife goes abroad for work.
After work he went to school to pick his kids up, now obviously he had to finish his work at the office but the head there was so impressed by the work that he gave him the ability to leave the office anytime but he had to finish his work at home which surprisingly he did.
Once he left the office drove to the school to pick his kids up.
"Daddy!" "Dad!" exclaimed both the kids, happy to see their father. "Ha-ha so how are my kids doing? Been good kids right?" "Yeah" was the answer he got.
"So as promised we will be going to the Gulhane's!"
"Really!"
"Yes!"
"Yahoo!" the kids exclaimed in happiness, well since they were big meat connoisseurs and loved their grandaunt's cookies, two traits they seemingly got from their mother.
After coming out from the restaurant, they went grocery shopping with the kids. He made this a habit so that the kids knew what was on the menu and there was no excess food made. Once done with the dinner he got his kids off the TV and then sent them to bed.
After that, he went into the kitchen and opened a small fridge; he took out a beer bottle from there and started to drink it on the table while thinking about what his wife was doing in the US.
At that moment, while drinking he again went into the cabinet and took out another bottle opened it, and kept it on the table. "You know, you were never good at hiding, god knows how you became a spymaster Jiraiya-sama." He said in a whisper. At that moment a man suddenly appeared from the corner of the room.
"You know you hurt me by saying Jiraiya-sama, and I thought my apprentice would finally call me sensei," Jiraiya said in a fake hurt tone
"Well with an irresponsible man who leaves a baby to an old geezer who couldn't do shit to protect him and another man who neglected him, I don't think so," Nakul replied in a cold tone
"Now Naruto..." While Jiraiya was trying to explain to Nakul now named Naruto, in his mind, only one thing was going on. "Shit! The House has been compromised and has to move. New York! Before that, I need to stall for time, so that I have backup. " Naruto was not an idiot to fight him there knowing that even if he had more power the level of experience would make him lose. Simply putting it was like comparing a nuke to a little firecracker
"Save your excuses, why are you here? Let me guess, the village wants their precious weapon back. Isn't that right?" Naruto said in a cold tone.
"No Naruto it's not like that..." Jiraiya tried to explain to him, but he was rudely cut off by Naruto
"Really how is it then? Me acting like an idiot, acting like I had a crush on that banshee, who used me like a punching bag, or acting like the dead last so everyone can laugh at me."
"Naruto, people have changed, they have realized what they did and are apologetic for it." Jiraiya tried to explain the situation to him but Naruto was in no mood.
"Oh really? Bet it wouldn't be because someone told them about my heritage and are now willing to lick my ass to get in my good graces. Tell you what, give me a good reason I should come back and I will."
"Naruto you have your parentage there-" Jiraiya started but was again cut off by Naruto's laugh.
"Don't give me that shit Jiraiya, that is the worst excuse I have heard, parentage, parentage right so tell me if I would stay there, would you have given me that? Huh?" Jiraiya was going to reply but Naruto replied for him.
"Let me give you the answer, It is once I matured right? Or let's go with once I became Jounin, which was never going to happen with those people there!"
"Naruto it's not like that"
"Oh it is like that, just because you don't want to leave your delusional bubble does not mean others can"
"Fine, let's just talk civilly, look I know we have differences and problems but please let's talk civilly." Jiraiya pleaded with him. Seeing the desperation on Jiraiya's face Naruto relented.
"Ok, let's do it, no shouting, nothing, deal," Naruto replied. "Ok"
"Look Naruto I know I messed up, Minato, Kushina wanted me to take care of you and we did not. look I messed up and I am sorry for that." Jiraiya said in a heavy tone. Here Naruto caught something.
"What do you mean 'we'?" Naruto asked. Knowing that he slipped up Jiraiya knew he had to tell the truth.
"Look Naruto, what I am going to say is a secret that only a sensei, me, Tsunade, and your parents, knew. And Tsunade was completely innocent in it." Jiraiya explained while stressing on the last part.
"Fine" "Look, It is in the second war that, it happened, after a battle, me and Tsunade got drunk heavily one night, next day to what we know, we woke up together, and then a few days after we found out she was pregnant and-"
"You are my grandfather and she is my grandmother." Naruto finished Jiraiya's story in a cold and calm tone which frightened him to a high degree, since the Naruto he knew would have shouted and screamed but he did not.
"So dear grandfather tell me, how is she, my dearest grandmother innocent in it?" Naruto asked while Jiraiya cringed at the way he said, grandfather and grandmother.
"The day of the attack, she got a false letter from sensei telling her that you did not survive the attack," Jiraiya said to which Naruto again completed him,
"Let me guess the letter was from Danzo bla-bla-bla." This shocked Jiraiya as he didn't expect Naruto to know this.
"How did you-"
"That son of a bitch and his two sidekicks are the bloody reason for basically all of my life sufferings." Naruto interrupted him.
"That being said, I'm fine with a civil conversation, no jutsus and no tricks," Naruto said in finality and stood up to activate some seals, which Jiraiya identified as silencing seals. "Seals huh" He said in an impressed tone.
"Nine years without someone trying to sabotage or manipulate you gives you a lot of inside in your own life." Jiraiya slightly winced at that, knowing about the blonde's dark childhood. "So, married huh?" Jiraiya continued the small talk.
"Yeah, the best thing I have done so far."
"Her name?"
"Luna" 'That's a beautiful name' Jiraiya thought.
"So where and when did you meet?"
"Here, about thirteen or so years ago"
"Are you happy with your life?" Now this shocked Naruto knowing how stubborn Jiraiya was, but what his tone and facial expression contained was nothing but acceptance. "Yeah"
"That's good..." "What?" He asked Naruto as he saw the look Naruto was giving him "You're fine with it? Really?"
"What so just because I didn't see you and was a bad grandparent doesn't mean I don't know that you are content with your life or not." Jiraiya replied and then he enquired, "Any kids yet?"
"Yeah, twins."
"So what are their names?"
"Dhriti and Vassilis"
"Huh?"
"What?"
"Thought you would give some traditional names"
"We both chose the names, she chose the boy's name and I the girl's."
"Oh"
"So what about their mother"
"Went out of the country for some work"
"Oh," Jiraiya said and then he continued "They would have been proud." This brought Naruto's attention. "Would they be?" he said in a whispering tone.
"You know they named you after my book that was the worst selling, when Kushina heard about it she had her doubts but Minato convinced her." Jiraiya chuckled wistfully "I still remember the day Kushina announced she was pregnant, I hadn't seen Minato so much happier in his life, not even when they were getting married. For them you were everything."
While Jiraiya was recalling the past events, what Naruto saw was no Jiraiya of the Sannin, of the legendary trio who triumphed in hundreds of battles in the second and third shinobi wars. He saw a man who lost everything he cherished and now reminiscing about it.
"And then there was that time when your gender was revealed, she was so excited that she even exclaimed, she quote unquote will keep any hussies from sinking their claws, and then she suddenly exclaimed about grandchildren."
"Would they have been proud of me?" He asked whisperingly
"Oh trust me both of them would have been over the moon to see both of them," Jiraiya said boisterously, making Naruto smile knowing that his parents would have been happy and proud of his life decisions. For an orphan like him, it is the best thing one can say to them that their parents were proud of them. For them it was worth everything, very few could understand the pain that he felt. He would compare the things he went through, the emotional pain, to what Itachi Uchiha felt.
"You know when the twins were born, it was both a very frightful yet joyous day of my life, and I thought I lost Luna that day." Naruto started opening up "We were both madly in love, well actually not from the beginning, she was kind of a feminist, you know the ones saying all males are rapists and all, at first I thought she was being a brat but as time passed we fell in love." He mirthfully chuckled "I was nearly out of my wits when she first told me that she was pregnant, I fainted," he said as he recalled that day "When she was seven months in I proposed to her, she almost thought that it was because of the pregnancy, then that delivery date I almost lost her but she pulled through, nowadays these five are my life."
"Five?" Jiraiya enquired
Naruto then realized his slip of the tongue, but he knew it was too late to cover up so he told the truth. "When I left the hidden lands I washed up on the shores of a country there I met an old lady who took care of me and also has a sister who is an orphan so took her in."
"So what are their names?"
"Dhriti and Shrishti, Shrishti is my sister's name while the old lady was Dhriti."
"So named after her huh."
"Yeah, she died, so I thought to name her after the person who showed me what life is."
"So, you live with your sister or ..."
"No, she goes out for higher studies so stays out but we are in touch." Jiraiya nods at that "So how is she doing?"
"After your abandonment, she is a bit worse but her health is fine she even now started taking work seriously." Naruto nods at that and then says, "That's good for her." Jiraiya now was losing on topics to keep the conversation going, he finally asked the unsaid question.
"Are you ever planning on returning to the village?" Jiraiya enquired in a grave tone letting Naruto know that he was completely serious and in no mood for joking.
"No" Naruto curtly replied and then Jiraiya asked, "Why?"
"Jiraiya, if it was only about me then the conversation wouldn't have been on a dining table over two cans of beer, it would have been in a park where we tried to kill each other." Jiraiya somewhat expected this answer from Naruto after conversing with him, but Naruto was not finished, "now, I have lived with me that matter to me the most, people who see the real me not the son of their esteemed yondaime hokage and before you say how at least I have a tenant who reveals things to me like my mother was the last jinchuuriki and as for my father I figured out about it when I was five surprising the village couldn't. Now as I was saying I have people who see me as 'Naruto Uzumaki' not 'Namikaze Naruto' or 'The Fox Brat' or their precious weapon. Going there is borderline suicide for me and I don't want to jeopardize their lives over the petty feuds of the villages." After the mini rant, Naruto took a deep breath to calm himself down and waited for Jiraiya's reply, he honestly thought that it would be on the lines of Jiraiya giving him some patriotic answer but his answer shocked Naruto.
"Okay that's fine"
"Huh?!"
"What? It's your decision, if you're happy then I am fine with it."
"So like no patronizing speech?"
"No."
"Okay well, thanks for understanding."
"Hey, that's what older mature people do, we worry for the younger."
"Yeah right, you mature, then Konoha loves Kyuubi no Kitsune."
"Hey I will tell you I am mature"
"Yeah right!" Naruto snorted out and both of them started laughing. Then Jiraiya said, "Hey, thanks for cleaning the air between us." To which Naruto replied, "No, thank you, you know when all this happened in a part of my mind there was always the part that was guilty of leaving the village, leaving what was once my parents' home. Today after learning about them I think I can leave that guilt behind." To which Jiraiya laughed and said, "Oh, no your parents are one of a kind. They will always be happy to know that you are happy regardless of what you do. For them if you loved to do something then they would have allowed you to do that, they once even said that if you did not want to be a shinobi they wouldn't have forced you". This moved Naruto to tears to know that his parents considered this much for him.
"Hey thanks, Jiraiya, I appreciate it. Oh, by the way, there is something you might want to hear."
"What?"
"There is something I can only tell you and Tsunade." This got Jiraiya's attention as Naruto was serious here. "What?" Naruto first did a chakra scan then in a serious voice he answered the question, "Those three old bats might try something to take the Hokage seat and give it to Danzo, map each of your steps and make sure not to do something that might bite you in the back." This confused Jiraiya as he knew about the elders and their mentality. "What do you exactly mean?" Naruto sighed and then said, "That Cyclops was planning something when I underwent the operation, and I heard him planning something with his sidekicks. I don't exactly know what they were planning but it was something that is regarding the Jinchuurikis and the Uzumakis. So, I knew it was dangerous living there and they mentioned you two too."
Now this alerted Jiraiya, knowing that those old bags were trying to do something with jinchuurikis is a big red alert but Naruto was not done "Also you should advise Tsunade-sama to investigate the civilian council, those motherfuckers have done a lot of fund embezzlement, you would want to check, during the geezers period most of the powers were in the hands of the council so corruption was at an all-time high and also you might want to check all the shinobis that were charged because some were falsely charged too."
"Hey, how do you know so much about the village?" Jiraiya questioned him, to which he gave a cryptic reply, "Sometimes it's good to have eyes and ears inside rather than having them outside." Which Jiraiya instantly knew, meant that he also had a spy ring inside the elemental nations.
"Naruto, by the way, what level of sealing are you at?"
"Ten, why?" Jiraiya felt a lot of pride and a bit of envy surge through him knowing that his grandson had surpassed him in sealing. So, he reached out of his pants pocket and brought a scroll out.
"This is yours now." Naruto curiously and cautiously stared at the scroll. "Your parents always thought about the future so, they also prepared some gifts for your marriage consider this as your wedding gift from us." And then he produced another scroll which when Naruto saw, he nearly gouged his eyes out, as it was labeled 'Hiraishin-no-justu', his father's fabled jutsu, that destroyed a whole battalion of ninjas in a matter of seconds thus giving him the name 'Konoha-no-kiroi-senko'. "This is something Minato wanted to give you as a coming-of-age gift, it's yours now." Then he gave Naruto a picture of them, which had him, Tsunade, Minato, and Kushina, and another of when Kushina was in her seventh month of pregnancy.
These drove Naruto to tears as they were something that he would cherish forever. "Hey wait here for a second" Then Naruto went inside his room and brought a picture of him, Luna, and the Twins, "She might want to see them so here you go." When he went over the picture of his grandson, and great-grandchildren, and then his eyes hovered over his grand-daughter in law and said, "She is a beauty" to which Naruto replied, "Yeah, she is my heart."
Then Jiraiya stood up and said, "Well would you look at the time, now good sir I will take my leave." Jesting a bit with Naruto as he good-heartedly chuckled and then said, "It was good to see you too gramps, take care and tell Tsunade and Shizune I said hi." To which Jiraiya nodded and said, "Will do." With that Jiraiya went up in smoke. Then Naruto had a question in his mind "How the hell did he find me?" but it was too late to ask the question.
"Well time to deal with the other unwanted guests," Naruto said as he sighed and stood up then went to his room, in his closet, and took out a black tuxedo and wore it along with that he took a katana and a shotgun along with ammo.
"Well let's get the show on the road." With that, he went outside his house while barrier-sealing it.
He didn't have to go very far as in the nearby park from what he estimated about thirty-five to forty people were there. They were wearing the same uniform that is ANBU black pants along with a gray color vest with a blank mask alerting Naruto that it was the ROOT – Danzo's goon army as he called it, since there were no real deadly shinobi in it. In Naruto's own words, it was a cheap copy of ANBU black ops.
"Namikaze-sama, we would like you to come with us peacefully." One of the agents standing in front said in a monotone voice. Naruto was having nothing of it, he figured out by sensing that more than half of the are ready with ninjutsu of all five elements some of them with kekkei genkai no wonder since he was a brawler in the past thus overwhelming him, then there were some with genjutsu, that also due to him being awful with that and some them with fuinjutsu, that put a nail in the coffin since, he figured out their motive, if not done peacefully kill him, take the beast, open the barrier, take his children. So he knew one thing for sure, he would be bathing in blood again.
"So let me get this straight I have got two options here right? One. I come with you peacefully. Two. You kill me." The ROOT agent nodded, finding no reason to lie about option two. But then they suddenly tensed, sensing Naruto building up chakra, "How about option three where I escort you all to hell." With that, all hell broke loose as Naruto charged towards them. Taking down the first two with a wind-laced Spartan kick piercing and killing them, then he ducked avoiding the two fire justu coming at him, and then himself fired an earth jutsu: Earth style: Dirt Rampart, five of the root agents got killed as the earth beneath them open up and spikes came out of it. Then he did a lightning jutsu frying three more assailants.
The ROOT then sent their sealing team, one agent tried the Five pronged seal on him trying to seal his chakra but Naruto saw it way earlier thus twisting his body then he sliced off the agent's wrist followed by slicing off his head. After which he wove the signs for a Fire Style: Dragon Flame Breath killing the rest six of the sealing squad. After this, he caught three other agents in Water Style: Water Prison the water being produced from the air around them, and electrocuted them with Lightning Style: Electromagnetic Murder. Then he threw off the nine of them with a Wind Style: Great Breakthrough.
"Now the real fun begins", he dashed off with lightning chirping in his hands. He slices off one of the agents' heads with his hand and then the color of the lightning suddenly changed to red and with it made a long stick that pierced the incoming agent's chest, then it changed its color to purple as Naruto forced his hand diagonally through another assailants armpits slicing towards the neck and then the lightning's color changed to white as in a swift motion his hand moved from the dead agents chest to slicing the incoming agents jugular. As the agent slowly died the lightning turned its color into pitch black while he shoved his hands into another assailant's chest and then he intensified the lightning frying the agent from inside.
Then the lightning disappeared from his hands and became black due to being coated with steel, which was found out as an agent raised his tanto to kill Naruto but Naruto broke the blade by stopping it with his arm. Then he grabbed the man's head and created a vacuum field around it, effectively suffocating him. The rest of the three were killed like they were just cannon fodder. He passed through them with two diagonal slashes and a stab all the while the captain stood there still, the last agent hoped their captain would help them but they were so engrossed in following orders that they didn't know that their captain was trapped in a subtle but effective genjutsu. So, in his last ditch effort before his dying breath, he undid the genjutsu on their captain which Naruto got the wind of, and immediately stood in front of the captain.
Then as he came to his senses he saw Naruto standing in front of him and he immediately looked left and right all he saw were the corpses of his comrades, of which some were burned, some wet, some pierced, some slashed and one had his tanto broken and was dead. Then he moved his head towards Naruto hearing the sound of whistling and then he saw Naruto whistle and his head moving downward as if motioning him to do that also. When he did that blood splashed and his vision went blurred till it was pitch black. It turns out that another Naruto beheaded him. They nodded towards each other and then the original went back towards their house while the other went towards the clean-up job. What both of them did not notice was a bird with a scroll flying away and a plant-like creature sinking into the earth.
Once Naruto reached the house he dialed a number, and the call was accepted. "Hello", said a female voice from the receiver's end.
"Hey, how are you?"
"Fine, why? Mr tough Guy is sounding worried my god!" She said with a voice laced with amusement.
"They found us."
"Them!" She was shocked
"Yes"
"So what are you going to do now?" She said in a serious voice
"Artemis, I don't know, I don't want our kids' future to suffer due to my matter."
"Naru I know you are worried but I am not going to help us in the long run, for now, be positive, where is the hubby I know and love gone?"
"He is right now at home, packing, ready to go to the US and meet a certain woman."
"Oh really! And pray to tell what the woman looks like?"
"She has a sexy ass along with auburn hair and the most beautiful pair of silver eyes that shine like the moon in the night sky."
"Don't flatter me, idiot! We already have two kids, want to make a third one?"
"Nope, these two are already troublesome, and do not want another one."
"Hey, they are our kids" With that they both started laughing.
"Okay bye, I still have to pack."
"Fine, I will receive you at the airport, bye love you."
"Love you too."
As the call disconnected he started thinking about his journey till now, how he came to these lands, how he met the man-hating goddess, how they fell head over heels for each other, and how they married and had kids.
Meanwhile in Konohagakure no Sato
A lady with blonde hair and honey-brown eyes was sitting behind a desk doing paperwork. Tsunade Senju, fifth hokage of Konohagakure no Sato, was doing her paperwork and lamenting about her favorite blonde, regret is what was filling her. All what ifs, if she didn't read the letter, if she stayed in the village and all others of them. She wanted a ray of hope so she sent Jiraiya out of the continent which was forbidden or more of an unwritten rule hoping he could give her some good news.
"Tsunade-sama" She was brought out of her thoughts by another lady who had shoulder-length black hair and was carrying a pig with her who had a pearl necklace around its neck. "Shizune," the now-named Shizune said, "Milady there is more paperwork I am keeping them there." Seeing that she was not listening, Shizune sighed, "You are thinking about him aren't you." To this, Tsunade gave a melancholic smile and said, "It has been sixteen years since he is gone. How do you think he is doing?" "I honestly don't know if Tsunade-sama, we even know he is alive or not." Tsunade immediately responded to the comment by saying, "No, he is very much alive, Shizune, he is too stubborn to die." Shizune saw her master's eyes filled with stubbornness so she didn't pry too much and said, "Hope Jiraya-sama can bring in some good news."
"Did someone take my name!" a boisterous voice came from the window, "Jiraiya-sama!" Shizune cried in shock, while Tsunade sighed and said "Well, speak of the idiot and the idiot appears." Jiraiya dramatically whined and said, "Hime that was mean!" Tsunade just rolled her eyes at her old teammate's dramatics, "So any news?"
"Well there is but, there are too many people in the room," Jiraya said in a serious tone. Shizune and the ANBU guards got the memo and quietly left the room. Then Jiraiya suddenly took out four kunais and threw them in the four corners of the office and suddenly four hidden agents were killed and their bodies instantly burned, "Danzo" Tsunade venomously said, "So what is the news." After making sure they were not being spied on he said "There is good news and bad news." Tsunade raised her eyebrows and urged him to continue, "The good news is that when I went outside the continent I went to a place where I found Nine-Tails fresh chakra meaning he is alive and doing well." Before Tsunade could say anything Jiraiya continued "But I wouldn't go and search for him right now." Seeing Tsunade's glare he continued, "During my journey back I sensed a ROOT following me and you very well know Danzo so I don't want to risk our grandson's life." Tsunade looked like she swallowed a bitter pill.
"And the bad news?" Jiraya nodded and continued "My informer said another thing, there are fund embezzlements in the villages by the councils and also check those shinobis with charges on them some of them were false." Tsunade nodded knowing what she would do next, then she asked in a meek voice, "Will he forgive us for, you know, hiding the secret?" Jiraiya's answer was "I don't know Tsunade, we can only hope he does, only hope." Jiraiya then left the office and mentally he was asking for Tsunade's forgiveness for telling her the lies but he knew this was for his grandson so he had to do it for his safety.
Beneath Konohagakure
A bird came inside a dimly lit office and delivered a scroll, a man opened the scroll and read it, then he spoke up "So, you finally show yourself Nine-Tails and are skilled too huh." Behind him, an agent said, "So what do we do now Danzo-sama?" Light fell on that man showing he had a bandaged arm along with one bandaged eye and a cross on his chin, he was Danzo Shimura, a student of Tobirama Senju the Second Hokage, rival of Hiruzen Sarutobi the Third Hokage, and most importantly the creator and head of ROOT the division, that is said to protect Konoha from shadows, "We do nothing Fu, we do nothing."
At the same time in a remote cave
Ten shadows were standing together, then the plant creature who had one-half white while the other half black came out, "We have found the final jinchuuriki!" the white part said jovially while the back part grunted and said, "He can now use all the elements and know genjutsu along with tai and kenjutsu." Suddenly a shark-like person started grinning and said, "Well this will be fun ain't it Itachi-san" Then a man with silver hair said "If he crosses my path I will sacrifice him to lord Jashin" while his partner grunted and said, "Shut up Hidan!" The blonde of the group said, "If I see him I will show him true art un!" Suddenly a killing intent washed over a man with orange hair and purple eyes commanded "Enough! Tomorrow we will discuss which jinchuuriki we will go after." and all of them left.

Chapter II
The Escape
________________________________________
That day after returning from the fight home Naruto went inside the house and tried to go in sneakily only to be caught by a small sleepy voice that belonged to his daughter, "Daddy, is that you?", Dhriti hugging her pillow came out of her brother's and her room with a pillow in her hand, dishevelled hair and her pudgy hands rubbing her drowsy eyes.
"Yes sweetie, it is me, why are you awake this late at night?" Naruto asked fearing his daughter might have listened to his and Jiraiya's conversation. Many might ask what the harm is in a six-year-old child eavesdropping, well not much unless you count the fact whose child it was. Dhriti was far more intelligent and perceptive than anyone gives her credit for, well, there are times when she acted like an airhead, missing the obvious sometimes, both qualities she seemingly got her father making the term 'daddy's girl' perfectly true. While Vassilis on the other hand has a strong sense of justice and is stubborn to the T but is very understanding of others and takes good care of others, qualities he got from his mother and thus was always jeered by his sister as 'Momma's Boy'.
Therefore, if she heard him, she would be curious, and that curiosity would lead her to things he did not want her to know, things that would lead her to his past life, a life he was running away from. Was he being a coward? Hell Yes! Is it necessary? Yes! If him running away from his life, would ensure that his children have a happy and normal life, though he was not counting the part where monsters would hunt them, still, he wanted to give them a normal life, and he would do anything. As he was musing, he was interrupted by something hitting his leg, so he looked down.
"Daddy, you were spacing out again! I was asking you why you have red paint on your hands and your clothes are so dirty. And since when do you have that red shirt?" Dhriti rapid-fire questions at him. "That was an escape" He mentally patted his back for his daughter thinking that it was red paint on his hand and not blood.
"Well Daddy was in the kitchen so had some ketchup spilled on me, so why are you awake?"
"I heard some strange sounds outside, so I came out." She explained innocently
"Dhriti, Daddy checked the outside and found no one, so go sleep, tomorrow I will give you two a huge surprise!"
"Really Daddy?!"
"Yes sweetie, now go and sleep"
"Okay, goodnight Daddy"
"Goodnight sweetheart"
With that, she left and Naruto released a breath, he did not know he was holding in. After dodging the biggest bullet he went into his room and started packing, not before thoroughly checking every corner of each room to check for spy seals or toads so that he was not being spied on, then he dialed an unknown number and said "House is compromised here, move to JFK" and only got a monotone answer from the other side.
"Copy that sir!"
The Next Morning
As the sun rose in Turkey, two children were woken up by the smell of pancakes and bacon as their father was making them breakfast. As if being hypnotized, both the children came out to the dining room.
"Good morning kids," Naruto said to them.
"Good morning, dad." Kids said in sleepy voices which could be easily misunderstood as a drawl
"Well, pancakes and bacon are on the table, come eat." Both the kids started eating and then Naruto said "Well kids, I have a surprise for you!" This brought both Dhriti and Vassilis out of their sleep completely and both their eyes were sparkling, urging their father to continue, "Well yesterday I and your mother were speaking and we thought about it a lot." By this time both kids were a bit confused about what was going to happen but they did not expect what was coming. "We are leaving Turkey and will be living with your mom in the US and we are leaving today." As the bombshell was dropped the kids waited. As the kids finished listening to their father they couldn't believe their ears and cried in excitement "Really!"
Naruto laughed at their enthusiasm "Yes, now go pack your essentials, I have packed the rest of the stuff and shipped them now go pack your bags we are leaving in three hours." Said Naruto while smiling knowing how much the kids loved their mother.
"Yahoo! Let's go"
"Hey no running in the house"
After some time, the kids along with their parents were driven to the airport to board the flight meanwhile from the Turkish residency database and Indian Citizenship database the name 'Nakul Sachdeva' was gone, instead was the name 'Nathaniel Robert Johnson', US resident who was in Turkey for tourism along with his kids. While in the car the kids called their mother,
"Hello"
"Mama!"
"Oh my munchkins, did Daddy give you your surprise?"
"Yes, we loved it, you and Daddy are the best!" to which both Artemis and Naruto chuckled at their kids' reaction. While Artemis chuckled at her kids' innocent and excited voices, Naruto chuckled thinking how Artemis the Brave and stoic goddess as he once jokingly called her Ice Queen, becomes so motherly to her kids. If anyone would listen to her right now they would have to double thinking wasn't she a man-hating goddess?
He still had to meet his brother-in-law Apollo, the reason being Artemis didn't want her meddlesome brother to shoot him as he did to Orion but after doing some research, he found out, well that bastard deserved it. Then there was his step-mother-in-law he was kind of on the fence about her. On one hand was she getting cheated on by her husband repeatedly and on the other was she throwing Hephaestus, her child off Olympus and the other numerous crimes against her other step-children bar Hercules, that bastard deserved it, well after knowing what he did to his wife's lieutenant. He did meet his mother-in-law Leto and in one word she was a sweetheart, if it was years ago he would have said how did such a kind person give birth to such a brat? But knowing Artemis, he knows she got most of her qualities from her mother. Then there was his father-in-law he honestly had no comments for such a hypocrite son of a bastard, like what the hell? You are fine with cheating on your wife repeatedly but are not fine with your daughter marrying any other person. Oh well fuck him, but he knows he can't say it out loud knowing that his wife was a daddy's little girl, and he did not want to sleep on the couch, he loved his bed and wife. Thank you very much.
As the saying goes 'Happy Wife, Happy Life' (Whoever wrote or told this was a bloody genius)
As he was thinking they reached the Airport, after all the security checks and all, they boarded the flight, he could see that his kids were visibly excited. After all for the children, the first three years of their lives they lived with their mother, grandmother, and grandaunt and the next three with their father. So seeing all their family together did bring them joy. While noticing what his kids were doing he started thinking about how this renegade met the moon goddess.
THIS WILL BE THE START OF A LONG FLASHBACK SO NO ITALICS ARE USED, THOUGH MAY BE USED FOR FLASHBACK IN A FLASHBACK
16 years ago Konohagakure...
In a lone hospital bedroom, Naruto Uzumaki was lying recovering from his injuries inflicted during the retrieval of his so-called 'best friend' and ex-teammate Sasuke Uchiha. It was the night after his operation of the critical wound that was inflicted by his rouge teammate. All his mind was going on was the guilt about not keeping his promise to Sakura to bring her other teammate back. As he was thinking this he suddenly heard some footsteps and quickly pretended to be asleep thinking that it was Shizune or Tsunade and would scold him if he stayed up this late. But then the voices he heard made him anxious. He knew those voices very well why? Because those belonged to the two so-called advisors of the Sandaime Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, he used to see them whenever he visited the old man's office. Why so-called? Because all he has heard from them is cribbing and nagging. So he pretended to be asleep to listen in to their conversations.
"That bastard Orochimaru got the Uchiha kid to turn on us, I still can't believe it!"
"Quite Koharu, don't let anyone hear you!" So, he was right both of them were here and were discussing the failed mission that happened and this got him a lot invested in the conversation.
"Listen Homura, I knew that this Uchiha kid one day would turn on us, just like the rest of that clan, they cannot be trusted." Koharu sternly stated while pointing her finger at the person in front of him. "Uchihas turned on the village, interesting." Naruto thought keeping that intel in the back of his head and continued to listen to them.
Homura sighed "I know, but what can we do? It's up to the Fifth Hokage, and we both know that woman is nothing good but gambling and drinking that's for sure." Naruto wanted to protest this in defense of Tsunade but knew the statement was half-true, "Well she does drink till wasted and does gamble her money away, but you dumbasses at the council is what make her job the hardest." He mentally ranted.
"I see we all came to an understanding." A third said all Naruto could see was a silhouette, spiky hair, and one arm in an arm sling.
"Danzo, why are you here?" Koharu's voice sounded surprised "Normally you don't show up in public places."
"I don't, but I came here to warn you that next week a meeting of the council will take place. There we will discuss what the future of the Uchiha boy will be." The man named Danzo said as he started walking past them and was about to reach his hand out.
Naruto quickly closed his eyes and pretended to sleep.
Danzo opened the door and his one eye stared directly at the sleeping boy, seeing that he was asleep. He thought it was a good moment to bring up something, "Listen you two, we have already lost the Uchiha, it is already painting the village in bad light."
"So then what do you think should be done?" Homura asked to which Danzo responded.
"As of now, nothing, the Uchiha is out of the hands so, we cannot do anything about it, knowing he is with Orochimaru, we are assured that the other villages won't get their hands on the Sharingan."
"But what if Orochimaru gains it? You know very well how he almost fooled Hiruzen and all the Suna shinobis by being in the Kazekage's body, what if he gains the Uchiha's body and the Sharingan and then there will be no stopping him?" Koharu asked him. To which Danzo showed a minuscule amount of emotion by a glint in his eyes that meant he had plotted something.
"I know that is why I have a countermeasure."
"What countermeasure?" Koharu asked
"The Jinchuuriki," Danzo said, this caused Naruto's stomach to drop, by the way, this man was speaking he knew nothing good could come out of this countermeasure or whatever he was talking about and would certainly harm him as his self-preservation sense was going haywire.
"That brat how?" Koharu questioned him. Koharu knew that brat very well. She had seen him in Hiruzen's office. It was not like she hated him or something, she had her fair share of war so knew the importance of jinchuurikis and their loyalty to their respective villages. One which Hiruzen has done quite smartly, by subtly manipulating him, so that he could aspire to become Hokage.
"As of the situation that it is right now, we need the village's jinchuuriki to be powerful and loyal to the village." Danzo stated and then continued, "Honestly Hiruzen was a fool to believe the villagers would listen to him and the fourth's dying wish and release his status just like that. Knowing his parents and heritage the brat has the potential to become a strong shinobi. Still, the academy did not help." Then taking a pause he again said, "While me and Hiruzen had different opinions on the matter I gave Hiruzen's a chance. Still, the academy results left me disappointed, then I thought that Jiraiya or Kakashi would help knowing both had great relations with Minato and Kushina and would help their son but that has also left me disappointed by seeing his growth, so I think now a drastic measure is required. "
As Naruto was listening to the conversation, he was thanking the heavens that he was asleep because if he was awake his eyes would have popped out of the sockets at the revelation, but he went through the conversation.
"What drastic measure Danzo?" Homura asked this time.
"Getting the Jinchuuriki in the ROOT. Making him the perfect weapon for the village." Danzo replied with finality in his voice. This shocked the rest of the listeners.
"Are you serious? Do you know what are you saying? Have you finally lost it? You very well know that Tsunade and Jiraiya never let that happen." Koharu roughly whispered to them. But Danzo was not fazed at all and then he said, "I know but what will a Hokage and a Sannin do if the council and the Daimyo are for the decision."
To this the both of them calmed down, Homura asked, "And how exactly are you going to do that?"
"That you leave it to me." Danzo simply replied, "Have a good night." And then he left, leaving the other two there. Then Koharu turned to Homura and bid farewell and both of them left leaving Naruto to his thoughts, especially to Danzo's one comment about his potential that came from his parents. This thought that ran in his mind had his mental gears running,
thinking about what Danzo said. Most of his classmates and teachers did not give Naruto the credit he deserved, he was not book smarts, sure he was a knucklehead but one thing he had was street smarts. Now there were times he did not show that, like blindly trusting Jiraiya, but there was a reason behind that he needed someone to teach him for his fight in the Chunnin exams, yes Ebisu was there but he was not of the same level as Kakashi but when Jiraiya himself introduced as a Sannin, Naruto knew he had hit the jackpot.
Obviously, he knew who Jiraiya of the Sannin was. After all, he did want to become Hokage so he knew about all the Hokages and their accomplishments, thus knowing who the Sannin were, but he had to convince Jiraiya somehow so he played the fool card along with somehow convincing him, it took him a while but he managed to convince the Sannin into training him though it somehow did help in the finals and the invasion, he felt like he did not get the recognition, after all, how can you not becoming a Chunnin after defeating a Jinchuuriki and a Bijuu.
Then his mind went to what Danzo said and somewhere it clicked and made him a lot pissed, along with questioning what really he wanted? Did he want the acknowledgment of the village who hated him for if not the most idiotic reason ever and how could he protect them if they base their opinions on rumours? Then his mind went to the potential part that Danzo said, and surprisingly he again agreed as it was true he was being sabotaged, now since he was sabotaged in the academy then what about missions it can happen there too. Let's not forget about trusting people, now since he heard the old coots (aka the two advisors, as Naruto called them) knew about his parents, that means the third knew about his parents and that means Tsunade baa-chan also knew.
Danzo also said about his parents' names being Minato and Kushina, now the only Minato he knew who was related to both Jiraiya and Kakashi was Minato Namikaze, Jiraya's student and also Kakashi's teacher, as much as he wanted to deny the fact that was telling that Minato Namikaze, the Yondaime Hokage, was his father. And that Kushina person they mentioned, was his mother, so he thought only one being could answer his queries, the being that his so-called father sealed inside him, the Kyuubi no Kitsune. So, he mentally prepared himself to visit his mindscape to visit the beast. He had done it once or twice by accident but not intentionally so he meditates to find his mindscape.
He opens his eyes and finds himself in the sewer which makes him question this place then he decides to move forward to the giant bars behind which lies the great beast known as Kyuubi no Kitsune, the beast of great calamity, who if swings its tails brings tsunamis to an area, the same beast who attacked their village thirteen years ago, today he wanted to face it straight not to take its chakra but to get some answers. So he walked straight to the bars.
As he approached the giant bars, he saw a giant orange fox sleeping there with one of its giant ominous eyes open, staring at him.
"What do we have here, my jailor visits me after so long." The fox's voice contained a bit of sarcasm.
"Kyuubi." Was the only thing Naruto said acknowledging the presence of the beast inside his gut.
"So why is my jailor gracing me with his presence, maybe wanting to take my chakra to heal his pathetic little body or to save the precious little Uchiha? Huh?!" The fox said with heavy sarcasm at first while ending it with venom while taking the clan's name.
"I just want to talk." That was the only sentence Naruto said.
"Oh! My jinchuuriki wants to talk to me, what? Are my ears ringing? Where is all the bravado of yours huh you insolent brat?!" The Kyuubi snarled at the end, directing some killing intent at Naruto. Naruto was floored by the amount of killing intent directed at him. It was so concentrated that Zabuza's and Orochimaru's killing intent paled in comparison to what he was facing right now. What he was feeling right at that moment could be compared to staring at death itself, but he stood there stubbornly without any outward reaction as much as he could muster. He wanted answers and he would get them by hook or crook.
"Oh! Little brave brat are you! Today I am feeling generous so pray tell me what my Jinchuuriki wanted to talk about." If the Kyuubi wanted he could have thrown Naruto out of the mindscape at that moment only but something was egging him to listen to the brat, normally the brat would have been scared but seeing his reaction today interested him, so he relented to Naruto's request. He instantly thought when the brat said that he wanted to talk was that the brat wanted to strike up a deal like some humans in the past did so, he knew what to do next if that were to happen.
"I want some answers." Was the only thing Naruto said, this threw Kyuubi off. He was expecting some kind of deal. He had seen a bit of his this jinchuurikis life and he was disappointed with his current Jinchuurikis prowess.
Even if he was sealed inside human along with his brethren he still had to maintain his status of the strongest bijuu. For that, he needed to have strong jinchuurikis, both his past jinchuurikis were powerful and he begrudgingly respected them but his hatred for them was far greater. But when he saw Naruto's life it was nothing but disappointment, the brat made a mask to hide his pain and then started believing that mask. So when he replied that he wanted answers this intrigued him even more.
"Oh and why should I bother listening to a brat like you?" it egged Naruto.
"Look we both know we are bound here for life, and from what I have gathered from the seal you die along with me." Naruto started speaking, "So looks like the brat does have some brain inside of him."The Kyuubi thought, "So how about I loosen up the seal a little bit and give you a shared view and senses with me, you get a little freedom and I get my answers. What do you say?"
Kyuubi thought about it and for him, it was a good deal, he got a bit of freedom, for answering so many questions that he knew wouldn't be that hard to answer like who is Kaguya Ṍtsusuki? Or something like that. So he accepted it not before throwing some snarky remark at his jailer.
"Why should I even accept such conditions from the likes of you?" Suddenly the fox felt an influx in his senses and looked at Naruto in question. "I fulfilled the first part of the deal, then I made the seal a bit loose," Naruto said seriously.
Now this amused and intrigued the beast more seeing that Naruto was serious so he agreed, "Alright brat ask away", Naruto nodded and proceeded to ask the first question,
"What is my name?" the fox deadpanned at the ridiculous question and then the deadpan changed into rage. "Are you joking with me brat?!"
"No! I am not! Just please answer." Naruto raised his voice, after hearing the trio, he did not know what to believe. "Your name is Naruto."
"What is my full name?"
"Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze"
That answer floored Naruto, his worst fear came true his father was really Minato Namikaze, and from what he could understand his mother was Kushina Uzumaki.
"What was my mother's name?"
"Kushina Uzumaki" Naruto nodded confirming his assumption
"So what was your connection to my mother."
"She was my previous jinchuur-"
"Wait you were sealed in people before me?!"
"Yes, brat! And do not interrupt me! And for you to answer yes there were two of them before you."
"Who were they?"
"Your mother Kushina Uzumaki and Mito Uzumaki" "Two Uzumakis, was there an Uzumaki Clan or something like that?" Naruto thought
"So were the Uzumakis like a clan or something?"
"Yes," This answer pissed Naruto off more, which means he was lied to again.
Now Naruto asked the most important question for him
"Was my father Minato Namikaze?"
"Yes"
This was the final nail in the coffin for Naruto. So the person who sealed the beast inside him was none other than his own father. So he was repeatedly lied to by the old geezer about not knowing his father and mother. Subconsciously he was drawing a bit of kyuubi's chakra in his state of anger which alerted the guards outside but when they saw him sleeping, they chalked it up to the Kyuubi healing his wounds.
Kyuubi was by far most amused. Why? Well, he would have kicked his container out of the mindscape after two or three questions but after seeing that the brat was subconsciously drawing his chakra out he knew the seal was slowly coming undone hence he continued answering him and seeing his anger flare up.
"Did you know where they lived, my parents?"
"Yes"
"Where?"
"As far as I can remember their house was near those with white eyes and those despicable Uchihas."
"So near the Uchiha and the Hyuga compounds" Naruto thought
"Hey, quick question so like I know that it was Madara Uchiha who took you in control but like it's okay if you hate him but why hate the whole clan?"
Hearing this kyuubi's flared up his killing intent in rage, "Do think you know anything about that accursed clan boy?! Did you think that I attacked that day because I wanted to?!"
Kyuubi's rant threw Naruto out of the loop for some time, "What do you mean by that?"
"What do I mean by what?" The Kyuubi asked confused by the question.
"By saying that the attack was unintentional."
"Oh so you don't know, yes what do you think I could escape two seal masters? No during your birth a rouge Uchiha came and ripped me out of Kushina."
"So you mean to say a rouge Uchiha caused all this shit I am in."
"Yes," The Kyuubi said without hesitation
Suddenly Kyuubi felt that his chakra influence getting better meaning that Naruto had kept his end of the bargain. He saw Naruto nodding to him as a gesture to thank him and then turned around and said "I kept my part of the deal." And left the mindscape. When he fluttered his eyes open he looked out of the window and saw the sky, "So about 4 am huh? Guess time spends faster in the mindscape than I expected." He thought to himself. And then he started to think about the night and formed a plan in his mind.
"They will start the morning check-up by 9 meaning I have 5 hours, the library opens at 8 so I will have an hour on my hand to check the maps to figure out their house. The Kyuubi did say that it was between Uchihas and the Hyugas, but it was before the attack so I have to check to maps of both times before and after the attack. And then search for it. I can search during Midday." He formulates a plan.
As the day passed and 7 in the morning came he discreetly made a clone transformed it into an adult and left it on the streets waiting for the library to open, as 8 am rolled up he got ready for the execution of the plans which simple, the shadow clone would sort out the maps while he escapes the hospital leaving a clone there and then in the library, they find out the location and he returns to the hospital.
He began to execute his plan as 8 am struck on the clock he started executing the plan while the clone checked the maps, another clone replaced Naruto on the bed and Naruto disguised escaped from the hospital. After leaving the hospital in five minutes, he took to the roof and reached the library in less than five minutes.
"I have less than fifty minutes in hand." He thought to himself as he entered the library. And then he looked around the library to search for the maps section, where his clone was waiting with the two precious maps, he so dearly required.
He located his clone as he reached the map section, "You got the maps."
"Yeah boss, the maps before and after the attack," Clone replied gesturing to the maps at the table.
"Ok let's get going with it."
"Yes boss"
"Okay so according to the map, the effect of Kyuubi's attack was more on the Uchiha clan and a little bit of the Hyugas. So while the Hyugas were the same the Uchiha were relocated, but only one part is common in the Uchiha map the south part of the compound which shares the boundary with the Hyuga compound and was also unaffected during the attack okay this is the place we will search here." With that saying he dispels the clone and rushes back to the hospital, where he sneaks into his room and dispels that clone too, and sleeps in his bed waiting for the evening to come for his next part of the plan.
As the morning check-up happened the Nurse told him that he was doing well and would be released in about two days, after that Kakashi came to visit him.
"Hey sensei, how are you?" Naruto asked putting his optimistic, happy-go-lucky mask on
"I am doing fine Naruto but I should ask that to you, how is my cute little student feeling?" Kakashi asked his eyes smiling.
"I am doing fine, just thinking sensei," Naruto said a bit dimly
"About what?" Kakashi asked him.
"I am just thinking about why Sasuke defected, I mean he had everything and he just defected, look at me I mean I don't even know who my parents were, if they even loved me or not. I mean I even don't know how they would react in this situation" Naruto acted in such a manner that looked like despair but in his mind, "Hope he buys this, come Kakashi, jump on the trap" As it would have that his Uzumaki Devil Luck stuck again and Kakashi fell for it,
"They would have loved and supported you in every situation." As he said that Kakashi bit his tongue at the slip-up when he saw Naruto's hopeful face.
"Did you know my parents?" He said continuing the act.
"No, but I am sure they would have done that." At this response, Naruto was genuinely disappointed knowing that Kakashi lied to his face. Yes, Naruto knew that Kakashi was forced to say that but that did not mean that it hurt him, Naruto was not dumb, sure an airhead at times but not dumb, yes he was childish but not dumb.
As Kakashi left he was alone and waiting for the hour to pass knowing for the rest three or four hours no visitors were allowed, thus he would sneak out and find his parents' home.
As the hour passed Naruto again sneaked out the same way he escaped in the morning and then made a run for it knowing that, the time of the day when Jounin and ANBU patrol at the level high, so he needed to be as stealthy as possible, one slip up might jeopardize everything for him, so he waited and moved passed Jounins and ANBU near the Uchiha compound and went to look for his parents' house.
As he reached his desired location suddenly while moving he felt as if someone's chakra had entered his body, he knew a bit about genjutsu so knew it was one of them but the problem was that he was not efficient at dispelling it, so he had to ask his tenant for some help.
"Hey Kyuubi, you listening?" He asked the beast in his mind.
"What is it brat?"The beast replied.
"Could you help me dispel the genjutsu?" He asked the fox.
"Fine." With that, a bit of chakra disruption and the genjutsu were dispelled, and when dispelled the scenery changed.
He turned around to see that he was standing before the gates of a beautiful mansion. He had a lingering suspicion of who this mansion belonged to while Kyuubi had absolute surety about the owners so, he pushed the gates open which had seals on it not before checking for any traps as he opened the gates he saw that The mansion was beautiful. It was a traditional two-story mansion, surrounded by lush, green grounds. There was even a small pond with clear water in front of the house.
'Okay my parents must be insanely wealthy', he thought with wonder. Money was something that was rarely available to him. He decided not to dwell on it further.
As he approached the front door, he began to think it was a bad idea to come here. What if someone spotted him? What if he accidentally activated a trap?
He cautiously turned the doorknob, hearing it click open. He opened the door fully, seeing the dark living room with a sofa and comfortable chairs. He turned on the lights, surprised that electricity still flowed in the circuits of the house. But it was all covered in a thick layer of dust, he started to explore the house. As he turned in the direction of the fireplace, he stopped short at what he saw.
The first thing that caught his eye was the uniquely shaped kunai embedded in a stone slab placed on top of the fireplace. Every shinobi or to-be shinobi worth his or her salt would recognize the tri-pronged kunai. It was the Yondaime's kunai. He now knew that this house belonged to the deceased Hokage. So he was right on the nose.
He turned around again, seeing the portrait above the fireplace for the first time. It was Minato Namikaze, decked out in full Hokage uniform, along with a beautiful redhead wearing a high-collared, sleeveless blouse under a long, loose-fitting dress with a wristband on her left wrist and standard shinobi sandals. A medium-sized bulge on her stomach made him realize that she was pregnant. But that was not what caught his eye.
The redhead was waving a peace sign, with a very familiar grin. The same one he wore whenever his mischievous tendencies surfaced or when he was really happy. Her face was also very similar looking to his own. Her exquisite violet eyes were shaped just like his eyes.
A tear rolled down his eyes "Mum, Dad."
After letting his inner turmoil run wild, he calmed looked around, and entered what looked like a study room, after some snooping he found a letter that had 'Mother' written on it so he opened and read it.
Dear Naruto,
Oh, my sweet little child, how I wish that I were alive to see you grow into a fine young man like your father. I'm writing this letter in case something happens to us and you are left alone. If you are reading this, it means that we are dead. We are so sorry for leaving you, baby.
First things first, I love you with all my heart, Naruto. A mother never stops loving her child, even in death. Know that I am still watching over you, and another thing; don't you dare visit me unless you are a hundred and ten years old! I want you to live a full and happy life and only die of old age.
Second, if you decide to become a shinobi, remember the three vices of shinobi life. First is alcohol, be responsible about it and don't become a drunk. Second is money, use it responsibly and try not to waste it. If you DO want to waste it, better do it on your wife. The third is women, and as your mother, I absolutely forbid you to become a pervert and a womanizer. Respect women and also, find a woman you love and want to spend your life with. Don't settle for anything less!
At the bottom of this letter, you will see two kanji. The first one contains my sword if you ever decide to take up kenjutsu. The second contains the ring with which your father proposed to me; give it to the girl you believe will love you for the rest of your life.
Once again, your father and I love you, no matter what. Remember that Naruto.
With love,
Kushina Uzumaki
P.S: Learn fuinjutsu. The Uzumaki's were known for it and your father mastered it as well. I have left ten volumes of fuinjutsu that I got from the Uzumaki archives, everything you need to become a master. Best of luck, baby!
Naruto was numb after reading the letter from his mother. He could not find the words to express how fulfilling satisfying and amazing it was to hear words from his mother, even if it was on a letter. He saw the kanji that his mother mentioned and smiled his face-splitting grin at that. His mother was awesome!
He was so hyped up from reading his mother's letter that he almost forgot about his father's. He put the letter down gently as if it were made of glass and picked his father's letter up.
Dear Naruto,
If you are reading this letter, then it means that I'm no longer among the living. I desperately hope that your mother is with you, but if that is not the case, allow me to explain a few things to you.
My name is Minato Namikaze, and as you probably have guessed, the Yondaime Hokage. If you already know this, then you are probably in the academy. If not, it is good to read. Keep it up! If you did not know about my identity as your father before this letter, please don't be upset at Sandaime-sama. I left him specific instructions that you were to be told about my identity only if you were a chuunin, or married. I made many enemies during the Third Great Shinobi War, especially from Iwa.
If people were to know about it, you would be a prime target for all my enemies.
I just want you to know that even If you are yet to be born, I love you with all my heart. It was the happiest day of my life when your mother announced that she was pregnant with you.
Your mother was Kushina Uzumaki and she was the loveliest and one of the most compassionate women I've ever met in my life. She is perhaps the only one who loves you more than I do.
I have left you another surprise in the basement of this house. Something of my own design and perhaps my greatest fuinjutsu achievement yet, other than mastering the eight trigrams sealing style. Details are in the basement. Enjoy!
Again I am very sorry for what I did but there was no other option.
With all the love in the world,
Dad
After reading his father's letter he was a bit cross with him but he thought he would make the decisions later. He took a sealing scroll and made two shadow clones and told them to take every scroll and stuff it in the large one as they were doing that he went to his father's study room and started packing things up as he moved to A rank jutsus he took the scroll named 'Rasengan', his famous jutsu, one that took him three years to develop and for him two weeks to master.
When he moved to the S rank section he knew one jutsu was missing, the same jutsu that made his father one of the most lethal shinobi in history, 'Hiraishin no Jutsu' but did not think much of it, why would a person, in their right state of mind keep such a jutsu so openly but still he searched a bit so that he see that if there was any hidden seal or not, but it did not result in success, but once everything was sealed in a big scroll and then he sealed the big scroll in a small scroll.
As he was leaving, he caught a glimpse of the three old coots and he trailed them to an old hut and eavesdropped on the advisors, as their conversation was going on, his eyes widened to a big proportion.
That night while everyone was sleeping, there was a blast in the hospital epicenter of a patient's room, specifically patient Naruto Uzumaki's room. As the chaos ensured, nobody ever saw a single person sneaking out in a hood with a storage scroll in hand, the person was a male child, age 13, had blonde hair and blue eyes, and the person escaping was none other than Naruto Uzumaki. The same Naruto Uzumaki whose hospital room was burned. The same Naruto Uzumaki, son of Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki. It meant,
Naruto Uzumaki had abandoned the village hidden in leaves or Konohagakure no Sato.

Wave Nation
In a remote part of the nation of the wave, we see Naruto with a boat fisherman's boat loaded with food and some clothes, supplies enough to last him for about a month, as the wind picked up, he knew this was his time to get away to his mother's homeland. His face had a stoic expression when he boarded the boat but inside he was excited to visit his mother's homeland, Uzushiogakure, or the village hidden in the whirlpool, the homeland of the Uzumaki Clan. As he was riding the boat he thought to his decision of leaving. Did he regret it? A little bit. Was it necessary? Hell yeah, he didn't want to be a mindless drone for an old shady advisor dude, his thought process then shifted to that eventful evening that changed everything to him, his goals, his identity everything.
Flashback: Five Days Before – Evening
As Naruto was leaving his parent's house, he caught a glimpse of the three advisors (or according to him three old coots). He knew these old coots were scheming something, so he decided to follow them. While following them he felt some chakra entering him but he did not ask the Kyuubi to dispel the genjutsu because he knew that it might alert them so he trailed them knowing it might be a trap but he still went to eavesdrop and then he saw them enter a hut, as they entered it he took to the side of the roof, where he could not be seen yet he could listen to their whole conversation. Once they started talking, he put chakra to his ears and started listening to them.
"What is it Danzo? Why call us here?" A female voice he identified as Koharu asked Danzo as they sat in the hut.
"Yeah Danzo, why summon us here?" Another male voice which Naruto identified as the other advisor Homura also asked Danzo.
"Settle down, I am explaining everything to you two." Danzo as he recognized told the both of them.
"Okay, then explain to us," Koharu told Danzo.
"I just wanted to continue our conversation that we were having in the hospital," Danzo told both of them.
"Okay, where do you want to start with?" Homura asked.
"You said you wanted the jinchuuriki in ROOT. How are you going to pull that off?" Koharu asked him, knowing where they left their conversation off.
"Straight to the point Koharu, so like you Koharu so like you," Danzo said a bit mirthfully.
"Explain your plan Danzo, right now," Koharu said seriously.
"Okay, okay, I will tell you." Danzo said, "I have thought that we banish him from the village and then let the ROOT ambush him."
"And you think the Shinobi Council and Hokage will happily banish him," Homura said sarcastically.
"No they would not, but what if the whole civilian council, some minor clans, and the Daimyo support the decision," Danzo said menacingly.
"What?!" "How?!" Both of them were shocked.
"I have had a hunch about the hunting squad failing to bring the Uchiha back to the village, so I had a backup plan. During the peacetime Konoha has become weak, so we need our jinchuuriki at his strongest." Danzo started "Most of the civilians have disdain for him along with some of the minor clans, so they would be up for the motion but not the rest of the shinobi clans who know the boy's real identity. But as for the Daimyo, he is uninformed about the situation so a little persuasion by his advisors did the job. And this is what we have here!" Danzo said showing a letter to the rest two.
"Is that?" Koharu enquired
"Yes, a letter with the Fire Daimyo's stamp saying that he is in support of the Motion." Danzo smirked and then continued, "If Tsunade still opposes the motion, she will lose the trust of the masses and of the daimyo also will almost result in her eviction from the office and I get chosen as the next one but if she lets it pass which is the obvious option for her, we get the jinchuuriki. So it is a win-win situation in our favor." Danzo finished with satisfaction.
"So when are you going to present it?" Homura asked Danzo
"Tomorrow, a council meeting motion will be raised by a civilian council member, to not get caught by the shinobi side that I was involved in it somehow. I called a secret meeting his morning to set the motion straight, kept you two out so they think that someone from the other side is supporting them." Danzo said.
As the planning was going out Naruto's stomach was dropping further, hearing their plan he had one thing in mind, "Whatever the hell happens I am not going to be their puppet." So as he was leaving he accidentally stepped on some dried leaves, "Shit!" He mentally exclaimed and made a run for it.
The same sound was also heard by the others so Danzo's private ANBU or ROOT as they called themselves from what Naruto gathered immediately went in the direction of the sound and they found something.
It was a cat, or specifically a cat with a ribbon tied on his ear, Tora the daimyo's wife's cat When they found it, they reported to their master, "Danzo-sama, we found this cat there."
"It's fine, go and make sure nobody else is here."
"Hai Danzo-sama!"
As this was going on Naruto was still on the run hoping they did not find him yet, not knowing that the cat which was a menace for every genin in the village just saved his life. As he was going again a foreign chakra entered his body. This time he was on the run so he did not shy away from asking Kyuubi to help him. "Hey Foxy!" he mentally yelled waking up the beast.
"What is it brat?!" The Kyuubi also mentally yelled.
"Quick genjutsu release please." Naruto mentally pleaded to the Kyuubi.
"Fine" With that Kyuubi pulsed the required chakra in his body dispelling the genjutsu, And Naruto saw what was like a hidden property, he quickly entered the property to not get caught by ROOT not seeing the seal on the house door. Once entered he quickly closed the door to not get caught.
Meanwhile, the pulse was also felt by Danzo's group, "Let's get out quickly before a team comes to catch the cat and also release it far from here to not make any suspicion." Danzo quickly orders bringing an end to their meeting.
"I will meet you again in the council chambers." He said, while the others nodded their head in agreement leaving the place via the route Naruto took while escaping them and also passed the same property but they did not stop, which saved Naruto.
As Naruto caught his breath, he took his time to look around the property, and he saw a very familiar symbol a symbol of the Senju clan. "Holy Shit! I am in some senju's house" He mentally thought. As he explored a little bit more he came around a portrait that drained all the color from his body. It was a portrait of the two Senju brothers, Hashirama and Tobirama Senju, but there was an unfamiliar redhead there too.
"Okay, shit, I broke into the shodaime's house fuck! But who is that redhead" Naruto thought, and then he mentally heard a growling sound from Kyuubi.
"Hey, you know her?" He asked.
"Idiot, that's Mito Uzumaki, my first jailor, and the biggest bitch!" He swiftly ignore the bitch part, but then he started thinking while sitting on a chair, "Okay I have a problem, Danzo is going to have me banished and turned into his mindless drone which I do not want, what can I do, think Naruto think." He mentally ranted.
"Why not run away from the village?"The answer came from the least expected place.
"Then where or better yet why the hell are you helping me?" He continued his rant.
"Look brat I don't want to be controlled by some old crook and love myself" Naruto took the argument in thought about it and considered it too.
"Okay let's go with your plan but where should we go?"
"We will think about it on the way"
"Okay" With that he took out his large sealing scroll and made several shadow clones, "Boys, ransack the house find every useful scroll, and take it and pack it." He commanded and started his part too.
As they were ransacking the house he found an old map of the continents and there was Uzushiogakure marked on it. "Hey Kyuubi what and where is this Uzushiogakure." Naruto enquired.
"It was the home of the Uzumakis" The Kyuubi simply replied while Naruto nodded.
"I think we know where we escaping to next." Naruto mentally said finalizing the escaping location.
"Uzushiogakure, so how will you go there?" Kyuubi asked interested.
"Uzushiogakure, it is beyond Wave, so we can take a boat from there and go to Uzu," Naruto explained to the Fox.
"Ok, so when are you escaping?" Kyuubi asked.
"Tonight, midnight, let's cause a blast in the hospital room and then escape while the chaos will be happening. Then go to wave." Naruto said. Then he continued by saying, "I also need some money to bustcase out of here." Then he created two shadow clones and ordered them, "Steal some money from the bank, quick and quietly." Both the clones nodded and went away.
"Hey Kyuubi," Naruto called the beast mentally.
"What is it brat?" Kyuubi asked Naruto.
"Want to make another deal?" He asked the fox, who raised an eyebrow.
"What Deal?" Kyuubi asked curiously.
"Like you said you were controlled by a rouge Uchiha, right?" Naruto asked knowing that he was threading on a small line.
"Yes," Kyuubi growled and said.
"So that means that you would recognize him if we ever cross paths with him?" He asked the fox again.
"Yes brat, I will kill him if we cross paths with him. Trust me." Kyuubi growled.
"Ok then how about this, you show me what happened that night and you dig through some of the original Madara's memories, give me some jutsus and training, and hunt him down and kill that son of a bitch, what do you say?" Naruto proposed the deal to Kyuubi.
Kyuubi hummed in thought about the deal, he had not much to lose and had much to gain from it. His jinchuuriki will be the strongest of them all and he would get his revenge from that person of that accursed clan so he decides to take the deal.
"Okay brat, I will take your deal, come to the mindscape we will further talk here," Kyuubi told Naruto.
"Okay," He mentally said and nodded. He then finds a nearby chair and sits and then concentrates, after some time he opens his eyes to his mindscape. "Hello Kyuubi," He said stoically.
"Brat" Kyuubi replied.
"So are you in accord with the deal?" He asked the giant fox.
"I thought about it brat, and would like to say yes but I also want that once prepared you would start hunting him," Kyuubi stated.
"Deal," Naruto said without any delay. This shocked Kyuubi. But was a welcomed shock, he thought that Naruto would consider it very well but such a quick response shocked him.
"Hoh! Okay fine!" Kyuubi said haughtily, then he continued, "So, what do you want first? The Night or Training?" Kyuubi asked giving Naruto the options.
"Show me what happened that night, then once we escape from Konoha to Uzushio, you help me with the training and then we hunt that son of a bitch and kill him in cold blood," Naruto said to the Fox and finished in a gradually angered voice.
"Fine brat, see the water below you, there you will see it." The Kyuubi stated as the water started changing color.
Flashback 10th October
The water changed to the scenery of a cave where Kushina was giving birth with Biwako her mid-wife during the process, while Minato was maintaining the seal ensuring the Kyuubi never escaped its prison as the process was in continuation nobody noticed a hood coming from outside.
"Hey, you state your business here!" One of the ANBU exclaimed, just to be killed by the man, the other ANBU swung his sword through the person just to find it phasing through him. "What the ack!" before he could do anything he was also killed. By this time the delivery was complete, with Naruto wrapped in a towel sleeping in his crib, Kushina completely drained and the seal being a bit weak.
Suddenly, the masked man appeared behind Biwako killing her and then killed all the guards, then reappeared near the crib picking Naruto up, "Yondaime Hokage give me the Jinchuuriki or this child dies." As Minato was forced to compel with the masked man, he threw Naruto in the air prompting Minato to catch him leaving Kushina defenseless, while Minato who caught Naruto saw the paper bomb behind his son's back immediately ripped it off and teleported giving the masked man enough time to do the same thing with Kushina whom he teleported to a ritual site where he ripped out the nine tails from her leaving her more exhausted.
After Minato teleported Naruto out he then teleported Kushina in but when he moved he saw giant smoke clouds then the Kyuubi no Kitsune in his glory came out, and the masked man transformed his visible eye from onyx to a Sharingan making it obvious that he was an Uchiha. "Kyuubi from now you will obey my command." Trapping it into his illusion as senseless destruction began, to counter the massive beast my shinobi including the third hokage came, while Minato chased the man.
A while later he reappeared when the Kyuubi aimed his bijuudama at the hokage mountain, he used Hiraishin: Dorai to counter the attack successfully overcoming it.
"Minato what will we do now? We can seal it back to Kushina, now what?" Hiruzen asked, while Minato closed his eyes, "I will make Naruto the new jinchuuriki." This statement caused Hiruzen's eyes to widen. "Are you serious?!"
"Dead serious."
"Okay set up the ritual while I distract it." Suddenly golden chain popped up restricting the beast. "I will also help, now go!" came from a nearly exhausted Kushina who glared at her husband when he tried to protest.
"Okay."
As he picked Naruto up and got him ready for the ritual, drew the eight-tetragram seal, it was a bit late so he thought of another idea, which by looking at his face Hiruzen also caught it, "Minato if you are thinking, what I am thinking then don't do it." Hiruzen warned
Minato replied by saying, "It's too late I have no choice."
"Then let me do it! I am old so my sacrifice would be miniscule!"
"The village would require a more experienced kage than a young one and I am the Yondaime Hokage. It is my duty and an order to you to not interfere!" He said a left without hearing Sandaime's next argument as he summoned Gamabuta who proceeded to stab the Kyuubi in place while Minato on top of the toad performed the reaper death seal.
The Kyuubi somehow got wind of his new jinchuuriki and as a last-ditch effort tried to kill Naruto which did not happen as out of sheer willpower both Minato and Kushina stood in the path of the beast's nail and got impaled by it instead of their son. As Hiruzen approached Naruto he saw Minato motioning to say something, "Sandaime as my last wish, I want Naruto to be seen as a protector and as a hero by the people of this village." With that, the Yondaime Hokage breathes his last breath.
Flashback over
Once he saw all that, he had nothing but rage inside of him, rage towards the idiotic citizens not fulfilling his father's last wish, rage towards his father for being an idiot. You had an old Hokage, past his prime willing to sacrifice himself versus a young Hokage, in his prime, can much better. His idiot father chose himself instead of Sandaime. And finally, rage at that masked bastard, that son of bitch who killed his parents, made his life a living hell. In his mind one thing was going on, if he crossed paths with that nonce he would kill him in cold blood.
After calming down for a bit, he left the mindscape without taking to without talking to Kyuubi. After coming back he finds out that his shadow clone had come back from his errand. "Boss here is two hundred thousand ryo in this scroll. And a few more storage scrolls." The shadow clone said while handing him all the scrolls. "Was everything done quietly?" He asked.
"No one would suspect you at all."
" Good " With that he dispelled the clone while thinking, "Tonight I escape out of here. Sorry, baa-chan but some things are done out of necessity and this one is, I am not going his (Danzo's) Puppet and would not be banished, nuh uh! " With t,hat he left the house. When he stepped outside he saw it was almost evening, "Shit, time sure goes by." He thought. As he left the property he sneaked his way back into the hospital room.
This is where something odd happened. He got some memories, memories that were not his but were in this very room, it was of Jiraiya, he told him that they will be going on a training trip next week or something like that, along with other bullshit about forgetting to pursue Sasuke, which ly agreed upon. It was Sasuke who shoved a fucking Chidori through gh chest and lung so yeah, next time he was going to return the same favor not caring a bit if he died. Then he forced himself out of those thoughts and discreetly created 3 shadow clones to satisfy a certain curiosity.
"You two go far from here a play any game and dispel yourselves also do not get caught, and you get me enough paper bombs to blast this room only." He ordered his shadow clones.
"Yes Boss!" Three of them said and left on their respective tasks, while Naruto only waited for their return, after some time he again saw some memories of him playing rock paper scissors with his clone while one won, the other lost and he found out both their experiences and thought process.
"Holy shit! This will be so much help in learning I could learn and cover a lot of things with it." He thought. Just then his third clone came with the required paper bombs to blast his room. "Boss here is the paper bombs as you asked" and after handing it to Naruto he dispelled. Again Naruto could feel all the experience the clone went through but another thing he felt was like his chakra control went up a notch, with all the wall walking and water walking he did. This came as a bonus to him which means he can do his chakra control training much better. "Whoever made this jutsu was a genius."
Now all that he needed was to get out of here, first, he placed the paper bombs in such a way that only his room would be blown off. He did not need excessive damage and for sure no collateral damage. With all set and done he just waited for the night to come.
That night while everyone was sleeping, there was a blast in the hospital epicenter of a patient's room, specifically patient Naruto Uzumaki's room. As the chaos ensured, nobody ever saw a single person sneaking out in a hood with a storage scroll in hand, the person was a male child, age 13, had blonde hair and blue eyes, and the person escaping was none other than Naruto Uzumaki. The same Naruto Uzumaki whose hospital room was burned. The same Naruto Uzumaki, son of Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki.
Naruto then made a run for a wave-like he never did before, not knowing what was happening in the village, as he was on the road he first used a transformation jutsu to look like a civilian and used multiple shadow clones with transformation to make them look like a group of civilians, as he was walking, he thought he could read some things on sealing so that he could feel a bit closer to his family, his clan, his mother. As he picked up the scroll he started reading it finding more and more engrossed in sealing.
He found out a lot about sealing, along with some with personal notes from Mito Uzumaki, during the three-day route to wave, It turned out he took sealing like fish to water, it was so natural that on the third day, he could make a paper bomb, adjust its impact, make a storage scroll and a waterproof seal. As he reached the wave he was shocked, to say the least, but was also moved to tears to see the amount of respect, to name a bridge after him 'The Great Naruto Bridge' but he knew this was not his destination so he again created some clones, gave them some money to go and get some supplies while he went and checked in in a hotel.
While in the hotel he made another shadow clone and dispelled it to give the mental command of where he is, he produced another shadow clone and they started experimenting with seals, they first used it on a clone to see if they could use a waterproof storage scroll on a person or not, once it was successful they did it on Naruto and made a storage scroll on his left chest so he could carry the big scroll there in case something happened and the scroll drowned.
Once his clones came back with everything he went exploring wave and went in front of two graves, one had a sword embedded in it. It was Zabuza Momochi and Haku Yuki's grave he took the sword, paid his respect, and went back to his hotel. Once everything was packed and ready with the essential scroll on his left chest, he went to sleep knowing tomorrow he would leave for Uzushio.
Meanwhile, when he was paying his visits, he did not notice a person following him. "He would like to know that the jinchuuriki is here." The person thought as he took out a paper wrote something and let a hawk take it.
As the sun came out the next morning, Naruto quickly checked out of the hotel and went to the dockyard where he bought the boat.
Meanwhile A Day Before Naruto's Departure From Wave Nation
Chaos is the synonym for total madness, which was what the situation in Konohagakure four days ago, as there was a blast in the hospital, the damage control was good, with a few being injured while fatality being just, one person who was very precious to the Hokage. Tsunade was devastated when she heard about the attack and immediately did two things, first postponed the council meeting and second, she called back Jiraiya.
The council meeting went without many hiccups if you can call it, that much. One big decision was that Sasuke Uchiha was now a B-rank missing ninja with dead or alive on bingo books. A decision surprisingly brought up by Danzo of all people.
Right now, she was sitting in the office waiting for Jiraiya to come to her office, along with her were the three advisors and Kakashi. As Jiraiya entered through the window with his usual boisterous personality, seeing the serious mood, he quickly changed and became serious. "You called me hime?" Jiraiya asked.
"Yes, Jiraiya," Tsunade said in a monotone voice. Even though the voice was monotonic, Jiraiya could hear the despair in it, this scared him so he asked, "What happened?"
This caused Tsunade to get sadder, which scared Jiraiya more, "Three days ago due to a blast in the Hospital, Genin Naruto Uzumaki is dead." She said with her voice cracking a bit in the end. Jiraiya's stomach dropped immediately. He without thinking anything went through some hand seals 'Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Ram' Summoning Jutsu, and he summoned a small toad, "Gama immediately get me the summoning scroll." The little toad nodded its head and after a few seconds came back with the scroll. Jiraya opened the scroll and looked at it and took a sigh of relief.
"Tsu-hime that was the worst prank I have ever seen." Jiraiya said in a content and chiding voice, now this surprised Tsunade, "What do you mean Jiraiya?" Tsunade said with a little hope in her voice.
"I mean look at the scroll" he showed the scroll "Look at Naruto and Minato's name Naruto's name is in red and Minato's name is in Black, as Minato is now dead his name changed into black, while Naruto and mine name are in red showing that we are alive. Okay, now what happened why you are all here?" He asked as Tsunade and Kakashi took a sigh of relief.
"The thing is that Three days ago, there was a blast in his hospital room, from them, we proceeded to think that he was dead." Tsunade began, "Now that I am here and he is not here you believe that he has gone rogue." Jiraiya finished. To which she nodded. Suddenly Danzo spoke up, "I certainly believe that that he has gone rogue." To which Jiraiya retorted
"And how would you know that?" To which Danzo just showed a scroll.
'Danzo-sama I just saw the Jinchuuriki here in the wave nation, he fits the exact description of having blond hair, blue eyes, three whiskers-like marks on each cheek, and a height of 5 feet give or take.'
Then he continued, "I had a sneaking suspicion that this was not an attack so I alerted my spies, one spy from Wave today gave me this via a hawk." Hearing Danzo Tsunade, Jiraiya, and Kakashi's stomach dropped. "But why would he defect?" question came from Kakashi.
"Does it matter?" Koharu countered
"Yes, it does" Surprisingly the answer came from Danzo, "Orochimaru gave the Uchiha brat the curse mark, and with his hunger for power, he became a flight risk and then defected but Uzumaki had no such drive to leave the village if my memory serves correctly he was fiercely loyal to the village and with Jiraiya training him he could have a much stronger jinchuuriki than his mother was."
Jiraiya nodded ignoring the last part. "So what do we do?" Tsunade asked.
"Well, let me do something," Jiraiya said as he summoned two old toads. These two were Fukasaku and Shima, otherwise known as Pa and Ma Toad.
"Jiraiya-boy, why have you brought us to Hokage's office," Shima questioned. "Over a decade of no visits or calls, and you suddenly decided to bring us here?"
"It's not exactly the Hokage's office that I summoned you both, ma," he replied respectfully.
He may proclaim himself a Toad Sage, but if one were to get technical, Jiraiya had yet to truly become a Sage. As such, he regarded the two before him with complete respect.
"Then what is the reason, boyo?" Fukasaku inquired with a raised brow. "You appear...stressed. What troubles you?"
"Well, I need you to reverse summon my student Naruto," Jiraiya asked them.
"Oh! Naruto-boy, I remember him, wasn't he the tadpole Bunta-boy and Kichi-boy were talking about? Ma" Fukasaku said to which Shima nodded and asked, "So why do you want to reverse summon him?"
"Nothing we are just testing something so that's why." Jiraiya lied to speed up the process. "Ok," Both the toads said and started "Gakyu Kuchiyose no Jutsu" but nothing happened. "Huh that's odd most of the time it works," Fukasaku stated, and Jiraiya while stoic started worrying about the matter. "Pa let's try with sage mode" Shima advised as they began to gather sage energy and then again said "Gakyu Kuchiyose no Jutsu" This also nothing happened.
"Jiraiya-boy what is this? Why aren't we able the reverse summon him?" Fukasaku asked
"Well, Pa I was testing a seal so that one cannot reverse summon or summon anything on the battlefield, and looks like it worked." Jiraiya again came up with a lie which both the elder caught but did not pry knowing their summoner would tell them later. "OK, so we will take our leave now." With that, both of them left and five seconds later the toad which brought the scroll again appeared there and leaned into Jiraiya's ears and said something, and left while Jiraiya's face got paler.
"What happened Jiraiya-sama?" Kakashi enquired. Jiraiya moved his head towards Tsunade and dropped the bomb, "As of today Naruto Uzumaki has officially deserted the village."
The reactions were immediate Tsunade and Kakashi looked disheartened, Homura and Koharu looked shocked while Danzo was emotionless. "Now what will we do Hokage-sama?" Homura asked.
Meanwhile with Naruto
As he was coming back from the grave he suddenly felt as if his soul was leaving his body and then suddenly the kyuubi's chakra flowing in him caused him agonising pain and he soon fell on the ground holding for his dear life. Then he heard in his mind as the Kyuubi shouted, "Brat! Quickly let my chakra flow through you!" and he did as he was told and he suddenly felt that sensation again this time it was more powerful.
"What the fuck was that?!" Naruto shouted in his mind.
"That was the toads, trying to reverse summon you." The fox replied.
"Shit! I completely forgot about the summons!" Naruto exclaimed in his mind thinking about this blunder. Then he remembered which toad was it, that kept the summoning scroll, he quickly summoned that toad, "Hello sir, I needed your help." The toad croaked, "I need my name to be wiped out of the summoning scroll." The toad croaked in surprise, "I deserted my village so I would like my name to be removed." The toad croaked angrily and then removed his name.
At the same time in Konohagakure
"Now what will we do Hokage-sama?" Homura asked.
"We have to bring him back," Koharu said.
"But how?" Homura asked.
"How about sending his classmates?" Kakashi suggested.
"And have the same result as the Uchiha's." retorted Danzo.
"I agree with Danzo here, the genins would not be able to apprehend Naruto," Jiraiya said.
"Then what do we do?" Tsunade asked.
"We send some Jounins and ANBUs to counter the jinchuuriki," Danzo suggested to which Jiraiya nodded.
"What if they fail?" Kakashi asked.
"Then we put him in the bingo book." Tsunade said but the protest came surprisingly from Danzo, "Don't do that we already lost the Uchiha, if other villages know that we don't have a Jinchuuriki many villages can invade us."
"I agree with Danzo on this, then give me six months to a year and then silently release his name in the bingo books," Jiraiya said to which Tsunade nodded her head, "Okay we will do that. Kakashi prepares a team and leaves in an hour."
"Hai Tsunade-sama" Kakashi left
"Jiraiya you can accompany the group too," Koharu suggested. "Yeah, I will do that." Jiraiya agreed to the suggestion and left the room.
"We will take our leave now Hokage-sama." The advisors bowed down and left.
As they left three of them hid in an alley and discussed.
"Now what will we do Danzo? Jinchuuriki is gone!" Homura exclaimed.
"I know that is why I sent my team of ROOT agents first to capture him, which is why I asked for six months to a year, as she will forget about the bingo book and we will have him," Danzo said and Koharu nodded as they left.
Present Time
Naruto sighed dismissing all the thoughts about him deserting, as now he wanted to live the way he wanted, not to be the happy-go-lucky punch bag or the dobe or someone's puppet. From now on he is Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze and has only one thought in mind, to see the ruins of the once great Uzushiogakure.
Meanwhile, miles above in Devanagari, a person one could say as a teenager with raven hair with a blue tint was looking at the blond with his green eyes, "Your choices interest me Naruto Uzumaki, your choices interest me."
As Naruto sat on his boat he started rowing it with a bit of chakra for strength, "Ok let's see according to the map I will have to head straight for two days and then follow the Polaris star as it faces my right side then continue the journey till I see two whirlpools together, heh interesting for sure." With that, he left the dockyard of the wave nation to Uzushiogakure not to look back at all.
Six hours later a team of five ANBU's with blank masks entered the Wave Nation and went straight into a shop there the receptionist saw them and motioned them to go to the backside. As they reached there, they handed the person a note and some cash, "The boy you are looking for is in the hotel near the docks, it is a small hotel not easy to miss, he is staying in room number 5." The ANBU's nodded and left.
When they reached the hotel the others waited outside in case the jinchuuriki tried to escape, while two of them transformed into locals to enter the hotel, "Excuse me miss we are looking for a room in the hotel, preferably if the room number is 5." The receptionist nodded to check not suspecting them at all since in her workplace she had seen a lot of weird superstitions. "Ah, sir you would be in luck as the room was just emptied 6 hours ago!" She said, "Oh thank you, please wait we will pick up our baggage." As she was about to nod she suddenly felt dizzy and fell as the ROOT cast a genjutsu, making her forget about this interaction.
"Spread out and give a message to Danzo-sama that the jinchuuriki has a six-hour head start and find clues about his location." The leader said to his team as they nodded and did what they were told.
6 hours later another team arrived, trying to retrieve their wayward jinchuuriki, the team consisted of Jiraiya of the Sannin, Asuma Sarutobi – one of the twelve guardian shinobi, Kakashi of the Sharingan eye, Kurenai Yuhi – Genjutsu mistress, Raido, Genma and Iwashi Tatami – the fourth Hokage's bodyguards and famous for the Flying Raijin Formation technique, a getaway technique they would require in case things go south.
"Okay I have met my informants here, and they have said that he is not here." Jiraiya started, "That means he has come here in a disguise preferably a henge to not get caught."
"How sure are we with his intel, for all it's worth maybe he did not come here," Asuma argued, questioning Danzo's intel, which most of his peers agreed upon, that man was known for his shady dealing and the constant get away from persecution.
"As much as I want to agree with you Asuma, we have to put our faith in his intel on this matter other than that, my informant also sensed some corrosive chakra, which could be of nine tails only," Jiraiya said.
"So how do we start the search Jiraya-sama?" Genma asked.
"Make teams of three, one genjutsu specialist in each, so Raidō, you along with Asuma and Kurenai are one team, and Kakashi you are with the rest and I will go alone, and if you come across any ROOT ANBU report to me," Jiraiya ordered. "Hai!" with that they all spread out.
"Hey Kakashi, you well?" Iwashi asked attempting to break Kakashi from his depressive state.
"Yeah as well as I could be, I feel like I let down Minato sensei again," Kakashi said.
"Look, you could not have seen this coming, hell I also have not. When I saw the kid in the finals I would have not thought of him deserting after all he did and beat Shukaku." Genma stated, "On the other hand the Uchiha kid, saw it from miles away, he was a flight risk from the start."
"Yeah, I should have not taught him the Chidori." Kakashi reminisced about his mistake "Where did I go wrong."
"Look all of us have a lapse of judgment from time to time. All we can do is learn from it and try to not repeat it, so buck up, because we have to find him." Iwashi said.
"Yeah, we have to." Genma also said.
While they were also doing their part Jiraiya was also in deep thought, figuring out why Naruto left, "Why? Why would he do that? I mean for the Uchiha it was very obvious, but for Naruto not. What compelled him to do that? What would it be?" Hoping the worst had not yet happened, he took out a piece of paper wrote something gave it to a crow that flew away as he went into a dango shop waiting for his man.
A few minutes later he saw all the customers of the shop dissolve into a crow, alerting him that he was in a genjutsu. "So you have asked for me Jiraiya-sama?" A man with long black hair done in a low ponytail wearing a black robe with red clouds on it asked, "Itachi Uchiha" This was the only thing Jiraiya said, revealing the man to be Itachi Uchiha, the clan killer, one of the most prodigious shinobi who was instated in the ANBU black ops at the age of twelve and supposedly had gone insane and killed his clan.
"So what do I owe the pleasure Jiraiya-sama?" Itachi asked in a monotone voice.
"Has Akatsuki started collecting the bijuus?" Jiraiya asked.
"No, we are still collecting funds and are right now testing their capabilities. The tests have been done for four to nine tails excluding the eight tails." Itachi stated.
"So who will be coming after Naruto?" Jiraiya asked again.
"It would be both me and Kisame or Leader-sama himself, prepare Naruto-Kun well," Itachi said
"Thank you, Itachi"
"My pleasure Jiraya-sama" With that he left dispelling the genjutsu, while Jiraiya exhaled a sigh of relief, knowing that Naruto was not in the enemy's hands.
While the search was going on Naruto was on the boat chilling and reading about the history of Uzushiogakure, it turns out it was quite the fascinating city before its destruction, he first went through Mito Uzumaki's dairy and learned about the early years of both Konoha and Uzu. He scoffed at the Hashirama Senju's statement, "Well so much for creating a haven for children to not kill each other, well the elders sure help in it." Then he found three scrolls with the names – Hashirama Senju, Tobirama Senju, and Mito Uzumaki written on them, but thought nothing of it and kept it away, to find his mother's dairy.
In that, he learned about the later years of the land and then its destruction by the three great villages of Kumo, Kiri, and Iwa. Then he found out about how she was chosen to become the Jinchuuriki of nine tails.
Meanwhile, the Jounin group was unsuccessful with their search and regrouped, "Anything?" Jiraiya asked. But only got nothing in answer, then he took a deep breath and said, "Okay no problem, we report this mission as a failure."
As they reached Konohagakure Jiraiya turned around and said, "You lot go and rest I will give the mission report." They all nodded and left in different directions as went towards Hokage tower to find Tsunade alone sitting behind the desk looking worried. As she saw Jiraiya coming in she signalled her ANBUs to go outside. "Did you find him?" Jiraiya cringed at hope in Tsunade's voice then lowered his head indicating the failure of the mission.
"Now what? Jiraiya. Now what?" Tsunade asked.
"Give me six months to a year then decide, the good thing is Akatsuki has not found him yet," Jiraiya reassured her. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Tsunade let her defenses crumble down which Jiraiya noticed, and hugged her without any perverted intentions.
"I can't lose him Jiraiya, I can't lose him like them, I can't lose our grandson Jiraiya!" She broke down. Suddenly they heard sheets of paper falling and looked to find Shizune standing there with her mouth gaping. Jiraiya closed his eyes knowing the cat was out of the bag. "How much did you hear?" He asked
"Enough to know that he was our grandson," Shizune said.
"Look what I am going to say is not what many people know except for a few." Jiraiya started, "During the second war, after one of our battles, Tsunade and I were completely drunk and the next morning we found ourselves naked in bed with each other. Weeks later we found out that she was pregnant, at that time only Sensei knew about it not even Orochimaru. Once she gave birth we decided to leave him in an orphanage at that time to not raise any suspicion, you know what could have happened if the word got out that two of the Sannins had kids." Shizune nodded knowing the severity of the situation. "Then we decided to give him my mother's maiden name 'Namikaze'."
Shizune's eyes widened a lot when she heard about it, "You mean to say that Minato Namikaze is-" "-our son" Jiraiya finished, "That means-" "he is also the son of the fourth hokage." He again finished. Then Tsunade spoke up, "After all the things that happened in the second war, I left the village essentially abandoning it and him, and went with you. Jiraiya stuck around and became his Jounin sensei, her from sensei's letters about how good he was as a shinobi. I only felt pride and guilt, pride as a mother, and guilt of not raising him. When he became Jounin we thought it would be a good time to tell him about everything."
From there Jiraiya continued. "I don't know if you remember but for a day or two she came here. We thought he would be shouting and wanting nothing to be done with us, it also happened but it came from Kushina's side, while Minato accepted our reasoning. That day we knew that he was in good hands. Then came the Hokage inauguration."
"Between those times letters were exchanged between us." Tsunade spoke up, "During the inauguration, I was completely against it knowing the past but Minato still wanted to get the hat, wanted to prove me wrong." She continued in melancholy, "In one letter he said he was going to get married I stopped everything I did and came here, it was one of the most joyous moments of my life, made me consider that I could live with them and wanted to come back but the feeling was not that much strong" Shizune could see her master crumbling down, "When I heard I was going to be a grandmother I never felt much happier in life, they wanted me to live with them." Then her mood suddenly darkened, "Then came 10th of October, I received another letter, thought that they would say it was a safe delivery, but the letter said that all of them died it broke my heart and I thought to never come back to this accursed village. So when two months ago a blonde with blue eyes came into the tavern, imagine my surprise that my grandson was alive so I confronted Jiraiya."
Jiraiya then spoke up, "She confronted me and showed me the letter, honestly I was surprised and angry at sensei too, but after seeing it well I found out the seal was duplicated"
Tsunade then growled, "Turns out, some bastard son of a bitch gave me this fake letter to think that he was dead, so when I heard about Naruto I made up my mind to come back to the village to fulfill my promise to my son and now he is also gone." She felt another person hugging her and saw it was Shizune then she completely broke down.
As the night rolled up, Naruto rested in his boat sleeping not knowing his life was about to change in a way that he would not expect.
Morning rolled up and Tsunade woke up in her office, looked around to remember that last evening what happened. She saw Jiraya sleeping on one couch while Shizune was on the other. After she woke up Jiraiya also woke up and said "You fine?" she nodded "Should I wake her up" He said.
"No let her sleep she earned it." She said. He nodded then turned around to say, "I will go out today to try to look for him, you tell the other Jounins that Naruto left with me." She nodded knowing what he was telling.
"I will do that you please find him." She pleaded.
"Do no worry I will" He reassured her and left the office, after that, she woke Shizune up, and she called for the Jounin senseis and detailed the information to keep quiet about this incident and tell their students if they wanted to know, then Naruto had gone on a training trip with Jiraiya, they understood and were ok with it.
During that time, while at the sea, Naruto was going through some of Madara's memories just in flashes to get an overview then he found something that came as a big blow. It was a memory of Hashirama, Tobirama, and Madara, or more like Madara was eavesdropping on the brothers, it told him one thing important, you cannot be acknowledged if you become the Hokage you have to be acknowledged for it at first by the masses. And well his popularity was something that was not good, not really after the recent stunt too.
This made him a bit downtrodden for the day that he was chasing an impossible dream and thought to do nothing for the day as the evening rolled up he finished his dinner and went to call it a day and let the waves carry him.
During that time in West Bengal, India
Dhriti Ghosh Agarwal, a widowed grandmother, lived in Digha in her marriage house raising her granddaughter Shrishti Ghosh, her husband late Shankar Ghosh was a lieutenant general in the Indian Army, so she saw a lot of incidents that happened in the course of history, whether it being meeting Subhas Chandra Bose and the formation of the Indian National army or the day of 14 August 1947 when India finally gain their independence. Then there were also the several wars that India fought against Pakistan and China or having lunch with Brigadier General Sam Manik Shah. She was also called the 'Army Lady' because, unlike other homemakers, she had the most involvement in her husband's army duties, so much so that she knew a lot about the army and its discipline. So much so that in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, during the later days of the war, her husband was killed. While her son cried a lot, she did not cry at all. When asked she said, 'Why should I cry when my husband died doing what he liked, crying right now means that he died a meaningless death, but my husband laid down his life to our mother nation, I am and will always be proud of him. Jai Hind!'
Given the 21 rifle salute to her husband's body, she had pride in her eyes, but sadness when she saw her son, for her ,son it was bitterness of losing her father, and bitterness towards the Indian Army, these caused tension between her and her son, she missed her son's wedding and her granddaughter's birth, it was one year ago that she found about her granddaughter, when she found out that her son died in a terrorist attack and her granddaughter was alive so she took care of her.
Dhriti was a wholehearted devotee of Shiva the deity of the Hindu Pantheon, most people thought that divine intervention was just superstition, but she knew there were truths to it, so tonight in her dreams when she saw a large shadow she knew that she was getting a divine intervention. "Dhriti, my foremost devotee, you shall help me in an endeavor, you shall save the life of a boy whose hair shines brighter than the sun, his eyes deeper than the sea, who shall be called the god slayer, who shall bring true justice, guide him protect him, my daughter. Find him where the sea meets the land." She suddenly woke up and knew she had to go, it was the Digha beach.
Same Time in the Sea
Naruto was sleeping when the boat was rocked with storms, so when he woke up it tides were high he tried to control the boat but the control was very hard, the fog was high and there were thunderstorms Also suddenly he found a shadow looming over him and then he suddenly heard in his mind "LOOK OUT!"

In The Sea
It was dark and the Tides were high when Naruto suddenly woke up. There were storms clouds and thunder woke him up. He went to the deck to see tides that were at an all-time high, on that rocking boat went Naruto tried to see far away but thick mists were covering it, "Shit! Can't see anything, Kyuubi a little help!"
"Brat, the mist has no chakra in it, but there is a layer of chakra after it," Kyuubi said, Naruto hummed and sighed in relief knowing that, they were not in Kiri's territory. Then the layer of chakra intrigued him but he decided to file it for later. Right now he was trying to stabilize his boat in these dangerous tides, the boat rocking was not helping him, sticking his chakra to the surface he started packing, and put everything in the seal that was on his chest, which was waterproof in the case of a shipwreck he could always run on water.
"Okay, this is getting worse!" He exclaimed in frustration as the boat started drifting wildly while he failed to steer it. Suddenly the boat was pushed towards the mist while he was trying to steer it out of the mist but was failing miserably. "Come on! Come on!" He shouted trying to steer it but failing at it miserably then suddenly lighting stroked at the water near the boat which was already damaged due to the waves so the lightning was a cherry on top. "That was very close to my liking!"
As the roaring waves carried the boat he saw something that almost looked like a ship, a big ship that was made of Iron! "Hey um, buddy you seeing that?" Naruto said to the fox. "Yes, certainly it is weird, never seen a metal ship! in my life!" The Kyuubi exclaimed. Naruto was a bit surprised by that statement as he thought the fox would surely know about these kinds of ships since he lived for so long. Then suddenly he saw the huge ship ride a massive wave towards them, and as it rose to the highest point it exploded. Naruto was frozen at the spot because of the explosion and did not see a huge shadow over him and was too late when he heard, "Brat look above! Watch out!"
At the 'Metal ship'
Mearsyr was a cargo ship that left the Surat port days ago, bringing some cargo to Japan, usually, they took the route of the South China Sea but due to border tensions, they had to choose the long route. From the Panama strait, a route that most sailors said was cursed during the rainy season and it being early August the season was there but still they thought it to be a legend and carried on their journey. On the journey, they did feel the air change a lot of time. Sometimes it was as hot as the wind blowing in the desert or sometimes as cold as it is in a snowstorm but did not seem to mind it since they thought it was due to the oceanic currents, so, they continued their voyages not heeding to the legends.
Legends are often stories that are passed down from generation to generation as stories to be told to their children as a type of bedtime story, but if one takes a closer look at them one can find that in every moral in any legend, there is a warning or teaching in there, so when they left without heeding the warning of elders and thought it was going to be ok, they were being the biggest idiots one could find. Oh well, money does blind people (anyway back to the plot!).
They started their journey from Surat, their route was from Surat to Maldives then to Indonesia then touching Australia they reached Japan, as they set course one thing they did notice was there was an extra engineer on board but thought nothing of it, as they say 'the more, the merrier' so they let him in, not knowing they were letting someone in that would tow with their lives and kill them.
As the pit stop at Maldives came to an end, the beginning of the end for Mearsyr started. Once they left the Indian peninsula and crossed the Lankan waters to the international waters of the Indian Ocean, the waves started to increase in length and intensity and the ship started swinging and oscillating. Then they entered a misty area where their visual range dropped to zero, the only thing they could see was the dense mist. Then as to mess with them lightning raining down on them.
Then cherry on top the crew heard several gunshots, some of the crew on the deck went to check the sound, and this time shots were fired from both sides. As it turns out the extra engineer they had on the deck was a terrorist trying to cause a war between India and Pakistan by posing as an ISI agent (which the crew did not know and thought Pakistanis were attacking them). As the firing continued the crew lost all control over their ship and let the waves carry the ship. As the ship reached a high point of a wave, two sudden bomb blasts made sure that all the crew were dead and the whole ship was destroyed.
With Naruto
"Brat look above! Watch Out!" Kyuubi warned him, but the warning came in too little too late as the first metal piece hit Naruto's head and pierced his left shoulder blade. While the adrenaline was flowing he dodged the second metal shard which pierced his boat destroying it in the process he lost consciousness of what was happening and then suddenly and piece hit him sideways and punted him out of the mist also experiencing that his body might have passed through a barrier and then floated in the endless water of Indian Ocean as the Kyuubi starts healing the wounds while clotting the blood and keeping them afloat.
In Devanagari
The deity of destruction was moving down the roads of Devanagari acknowledging the Apsaras that were there and moving towards one certain location, it was the temple of the god of water and seas Varun.
"Varun I need your assistance with something," Shiva said
"Lord Shiva, a pleasure, How may I help you?" Varun asked.
"Do you know about the ship that got destroyed today?"
"Ah! The cargo ship."
"Yes."
"I knew about it, but the poor ship had to poke its nose somewhere not required and paid the price for it."
"Yes, but there is another thing due to that ship wreckage there is a person of the moving continent that has escaped its barriers."
"So what do you need my lord? Drown him?"
"No guide the child towards to shores of the beach of Digha in West Bengal."
"At once, my lord."
"Fine."
As soon as Shiva left Varun searched for the boy and looked at him, the boy had blonde hair and was covered in blood so he raised the water speed such that the boy could reach the land in 5 minutes.
"You did not ask any question to lord Shiva about his motives towards the child. Why?" asked a female voice behind Varun.
"Sometimes I don't get his motives myself, Gauri," Varun said looking at his wife.
"Then why assist him?" She asked again
"I don't doubt him at all. All the mortal champions he or lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma have chosen till this date have only helped us and the mortals"
"Ravana"
"Exceptions are always there my dear."
"Hope this child is not one of them."
"You know it too we cannot write anyone's destiny. It is only their's to create. All we can do is hope for the best."
"Yes, dear." She said as she looked at Naruto drifting in the water.
At Digha Beach
Dhriti might be a lot of things but athletic at her age was not one of them, as she reached the shores of Digha, she waited there thinking that some kind of boat would come with a child in it but saw nothing of it. While she was thinking all that Varun had transported Naruto towards a remote shore of the beach. While leaving a little blood trail towards Dhriti.
It is a ritual in the Hindu pantheon to have a moral test for the guardian or the champion to see his or her moral compass. Is he or she selfless for his or her cause or are they doing it for their gain? If the person is a selfish person they will immediately eliminate him or her. So now the test was for Dhriti, will she wait for a boat or something for his arrival or will she follow the blood trail to save him? If she does not then Naruto will not only be cured but also be taken care of along with Dhriti's granddaughter in Naruto's care when he is mature enough.
As Dhriti was waiting on the beach oblivious to the ongoing test, she saw the beach water having a little bit of red tint to it which blew alarms in her head as from her husband's occupation she knew this was blood so without a second thought she followed the trail to the remote part of the beach, when she reached there she gasped at the horror as she saw our protagonist bloodied and battered. This site might have caused panic amongst common people but then again when was she a common person without a thought she picked Naruto up and ran towards a nearby hospital.
Most of the divine intervention receivers might have been at a cross between helping him or waiting for the champion but Dhriti was not one of them, for her the champion could go and complain to her lord all he or she could but she was not going to sacrifice a person's life if it was it her power to help them, this was one promise she made to herself after losing her son and daughter in law. If that day she gave her son the necessary shoulder he required maybe his life wouldn't have been forfeited. So without a second thought, she brought him to the hospital.
At Hospital
Old Digha Oghorkamini Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals near the Digha beach, and a hospital in which she knew some of the doctors, so they would not meddle with the bloodied boy hence she carried the boy towards the hospital. As she entered the hospital the receptionist recognised her, "Oh Army Dida (endearing term for 'grandma') (pronunciation of 'D' is as that of 'th' in them) what bring you here?"
Once Dhriti saw the receptionist she sighed in relief, "Oh Akriti thank god you are here!"
"What happened?" the receptionist asked alarmed.
"I need you to take this boy to the emergency room immediately!" She said in a panic worrying about his open wounds and blood loss.
"Ok yes me doing just that!" She said she called the team of nurses as they took him from Dhriti to the emergency room and then a doctor came in the room and operated on him while it was going she just prayed to Shiva wishing for that unknown boy's recovery. As the doctor comes out of the room she approaches the doctor, "Abhijit what happened? Is he fine?" she asks in rapid succession.
"Yes he is fine but the thing is where did you find him?"
"A remote shore at the beach"
"Odd, but do you know him? Because he might be a spy or illegal immigrant due to his blond hair and blue eyes."
"Oh no, I very well know him. But how is he?" she diverted the question by telling a half lie, in her mind one thing was going on, "He might be the one! A boy whose hair shines brighter than the sun, his eyes deeper than the sea! Yes, he is the one!"
"Well he is doing well but the injuries were severe, it is a pure miracle that he survived." The doctor's voice broke her out of her thoughts, "Those injuries were life-threatening, about an inch of the wound on the right chest along with 2nd-degree burns and multiple slash wounds."
"So what is the recovery time?"
"A week or two in normal care with one must day in the emergency room."
"Ok today he stays here, and then take him to my house there I will take care of him."
"Ok as you wish Dida."
"And Abhijit don't register this operation and mention it too" To this the doctor only nodded acknowledging her, "Also tell Akriti the same along with the nurses."
"Will do."
She nodded and then stayed there, "Tell me when he gains consciousness, I am here" He nodded
As everything was going on she stayed there and dozed off on the chair outside his room. As she dozed off she had a divine dream, "Dhriti my daughter" Shiva started while Dhriti expected him to be disappointed not doing her job. "I am very proud of you"
"My lord you are-. Huh, what?!"
"I said, I am proud of you"
"So you are not disappointed with me for not waiting" Shiva nodded while she was doing a victory dance like a child would do when they are not scolded but praised for something. Shiva chuckled at the display "Now, now easy Dhriti" Shiva lightly chided while she had an embarrassed blush on her cheeks Shiva continued, "I have come to congratulate you on your recent achievement, not only you have brought the champion to safety, but but passed the test."
Dhriti nodded to this that her assumption was correct on the champion thing but then something that Shiva said felt weird "My lord what do you mean by me passing the test?"
"Oh we give tests to every champion and caretaker of the champion to see their morality, should you have not taken care of him you would have failed the test," Shiva stated while Dhriti nodded.
"My daughter guides him. Guide him towards the path of righteousness." Shiva said.
"I will my lord," Dhriti said as Shiva left her dream giving her the rest required for her.
As the night passed she woke up the next morning with a bit of sore back. When she woke up she saw that Abhijit was walking up the hallway towards the room, "Is he fine?"
"Slept all night without any complexion, surprisingly high rate of recovery so you can take him by afternoon." He said. "Okay, then get him ready."
While this all was happening in the patient's room Naruto was slowly waking up. His whole body was sore to say the least, thinking only one thing why was he getting such comeuppance? What has he done wrong?
"So you finally woke up brat," Kyuubi said in his mind. This made Naruto open his senses a bit more, "Hey Kyuubi where are we?"
"Don't know Brat wherever we are it is not the elemental nations. It seems we cross the veil." Kyuubi said, "What veil, what are you talking about?" Naruto asked
"Nothing! Forget about anything I said. All I can say right now is that we are in some other part of the world and it is not in elemental nations." Kyuubi said while thinking "The brat needs not to know about the veil right now. When the time comes and if it comes then I will tell him."
As the fox thought, Naruto was trying to move every muscle of his body, trying his level best but to no avail. Then he saw in his blurred vision two people walking into his room, he wanted to ask them where he was but felt extreme fatigue from even opening his mouth, then one of them approached him and said something he could not understand as if they were speaking a different language. From what he could gather the person was a female and her words were very soothing along with the head caressing, she made him sleep instantly once again.
Dhriti when entered the room, she saw Naruto stirring up so she went to him, knowing the extent of the injury she soothed him by telling him to go to sleep. Abhijit was there standing by the door staring at the old woman, he had never seen such maternal love, since her son's death. He knew that the child was someone from her family but the question begged who?
"Dida I wanted to know, if it is not too personal. What is his relation to you?" Abhijit asked curiously, which put Dhriti in a bind. If she did not answer the question it would arouse suspicion in their mind so she had to think up on a quick and a good lie. So she started her melodramatic sob story in her way to divert the attention from people.
"He is my grandson." She said in a manner that was like dropping a bombshell. The reaction was as expected Abhijit's eyes widened and mouth agape, "How?" was his only question.
"Well, when a man and a woman-" Dhriti began but Abhijit cut her off, "I know that but I am asking how? He has blonde hair and as far as I can remember neither your son nor your daughter-in-law had blonde hair." The only response he got was "He is my grandson, nothing more, nothing less." The Abhijit what she meant and asked, "Illegitimate?" and he got a nod as his answer, confirming his suspicions but he did not pry further due to the amount of respect for the woman he had, as someone who set his career as a doctor from a petty thief in his teens.
"So when can I take him home?" She asked him.
"In about an hour." She nodded at that response.
As an hour passed, she was still outside Naruto's room. Abhijit then came to her, "Okay he is ready for the release, we will get him in a wheelchair and you can take him home."
Then a team of nurses came inside the room and manhandled him to get him into the wheelchair as that happened he was finally brought out of the room, he was, in a semi-conscious state almost looking like a zombie with his pale complexion. Dhriti took him in his wheelchair and then moved him towards the gate of the hospital. As they were moving him not many people queried about Naruto since they had seen her in the Hospital quite often, helping random patients sometimes bringing them to a taxi, escorting them to their houses. So they thought it was the same for this person too.
Then Abhijit called a taxi and stopped it, the driver peeks out of the window and asks, "Where?" then Abhijit said "Army Lady's house" and the driver nodded. This was one beauty about West Bengal, if you are renowned in your area then every other locomotive driver would know your house, and the locality is like family, so they would know everything about your home and family and all the family becomes relatives to the point the kids call the adults, Uncle and Aunty while the Elderly grandpa and grandma.
So when the taxi arrived there along with Naruto in it everyone was curious as to who had come into her home. Then she took him inside the house, on the ground floor inside a room, she had already a guest room ready so it was not an issue, then he was dismantled from the wheelchair and onto the bed then let him rest as sleep took over him, then she went to satisfy the quires of the locality.
One thing that was odd about Dhriti's house was that, though being in her late 50's she did not have any house help. One thing she always insisted on was not having any house help. She always said that she did not want any help until she had kicked the bucket or had some illness. So till then, she wanted to do everything on her own. However, from time to time, some people from her locality insist on helping her out of their admiration and respect for her.
So after she had settled some queries of the locality by stating that Naruto was a friend's son who had paralysis, she went home. And locality bought it since she had a lot of foreign friends, so having a cripple son of a friend in her house was not a problem.
Dhriti entered her house and after freshening up she went into Naruto's room, where he was still sleeping. She gave him saline water while giving him a massage to relax his muscles which was contracted beyond belief. And then gave him acupuncture to restore the muscles, as this was going on Naruto who was in a semiconscious state was feeling relaxed like never before. It was like heaven on Earth for him.
After a week of the same treatment for him, the saline water, massage, and acupuncture. His face was now regaining color while the muscles were relaxing a lot, which gave Dhriti a glimmer of hope that he was recovering. During this period she also got a feeling, she had long since forgotten. Caring for him had awakened the feeling of maternal love. Her only granddaughter was sent to a boarding school by her, which both of them understood as she wanted some alone time to cope with her parent's death, so she was sent. But she always came here during Durga Puja and Summer Vacation to spend time with her grandmother, a time when both felt happiness in the company of each other.
So when she saw Naruto she had one thing in mind, "You work in mysterious ways, my lord. You might be a champion for god but for me, you are not. You might be a warrior, but I will not treat you as one but as my grandson. Thank you, Lord, for giving me the chance." As she said that as if it was like Naruto had listened his facial muscle had turned into a smile, which fluttered Dhriti's heart as she smiled at him with motherly love.
This treatment lasted three more days and after ten days, Naruto fully became conscious. The first thing that he saw was the ceiling with something circular that looked like it was rotating (a ceiling fan) that was providing him air. Then the next thing he noticed was that he was on a much more comfortable bed than he had back in the village next thing he saw there was a wooden door in front of him and a glass beside him on his left.
"You are still a bit weak so refrain from a lot of movement please." He heard what sounded to be a female speaking something gibberish as he turned around he said. "{Who are you?!}" (please note that { With Italics}means that I am writing Japanese as I do not have the patience or mind to translate English to Japanese, so yeah!) Dhriti first tried to speak with him in English, seeing his blond hair and blue eyes she got the idea he might be from the West. But when she heard him, he was speaking Japanese which was weird for her due to his hair and eye color.
The Dhriti with a heavy accent spoke, "{What is your name?}"
Naruto was shocked when he heard her, speaking something he could understand. He quickly replied, "{My name is Uzumaki Naruto, what is your name, old lady?}"
Dhriti chuckled at the old lady's remark and then she said, "{Well my name is Ghosh Agarwal Dhriti.}"
Then he asked, "{Um where are we, old lady?}"
"{We are in West Bengal, India}" She replied.
"{Where is India, is it in the land of water}" He asked. Being the airhead he is, he forgot that Kyuubi said that they were NOT IN ELEMENTAL NATIONS. Kyuubi hearing the answer face palmed, "Idiot!".
"{Land of water?}"
"{Land of fire, land of water you know? Elemental nations?}"
"{I am sorry my child, but where is elemental nations?}"
This shocked Naruto, and then Dhriti walked out of the room leaving him alone. After some time she came with a piece of paper with her, "{Naruto please tell where is elemental nations are on this map.}"
As Naruto frantically searched around on the map to find the land he could not find it there, "{It-It is no-not there!}" He said shaking while sobbing a bit thinking about the mess as the situation was a bit to handle. Dhriti seeing this wrapped her arm around the sobbing boy and caressed his hair, "{Shh, it's okay, everything will be fine eventually.}"
As his sobbing came to an end, he suddenly asked the question whisperingly, "{Why?}"
"{Why what?}"
"{Why do you CARE FOR ME?!}" His sudden shout did shock her but the question made her more inquisitive, "{Why should I not care for you?}"
"{All of you old people are the same, you all manipulate and use me!}" He snarled still hurt from recent events that happened to him so the trust department was a little- oh well mostly closed for now. When Dhriti heard this all she could think that what kind of life he had to live he was paranoid to this level. While most people would have maintained their distance from him, giving him space unfortunately or fortunately for Naruto Dhriti was a Delhiite, so she would not leave him alone. She would make him he would feel safe and would become a parental figure in his life.
During the following days, Naruto was still recovering. While physically he was improving, mentally, the story was very different. The paranoia was on the next level, the first day, he didn't eat at all thinking the food might be adulterated, but in front of food his mental barriers crumbled and he ate, what was a simple fish curry but for him it was simply heaven (shows what hunger can do to people). As all of this was going on, he had a small talk with her.
From all the small talk she had with Naruto, she got to know that he was an orphan, and had no relatives, this small piece of information only strengthened the fire of determination to be a strong parental figure for him. It was a way to give the young child a good future and a path of redemption for the failure of the mother she was. The next few days followed the same pattern but this time Naruto was a bit warming up to Dhriti, he was still as cold as he was during meeting her for the first time but had mellowed out a bit with now the answers being one-liners from the past 'hn's. During this time only Dhriti jokingly propped a question to get a reaction from Naruto "{Will you be my grandson?}" Only to get a cold rebuttal in the form of 'No' and 'Forget it' but in all, from Dhriti's point of view, their bonding was beginning.
What Dhriti did not know was that tomorrow would be a day she would not forget in her life, a day which would not only skyrocket the bond between her and Naruto but also her chance of redemption and his getting a parental figure will increase.
It was a normal morning, nothing out of the usual for anyone. It could be said the same for the Ghosh house too, as Dhriti and Naruto woke up, greeted each other, and then ate their breakfast in relative quietness, a thing that they both appreciated very much. During his stay here Naruto was familiarized with tea, a drink he has quite taken a liking to.
During his stay here another thing Naruto now wanted to do was training, so he went to the roof to do that. Since his tenant was still sleeping and recovering he thought to use summons then he remembered one crucial thing he did not have any summons now, his mind was going through one thing what would he do now, then a memory popped up in Naruto's mind. It was off when he and Jiraiya went to retrieve Tsunade, that time while they were resting near a shrine, Jiraiya told him about his team meeting and test, at least Sarutobi Hiruzen was a competent teacher that Hatake Kakashi, he could not help but give a jab towards his so-called sensei.
When he hears those stories from Jiraiya, he remembers how Jiraiya got his summons, it was not through a summoning scroll but by doing the hand signs to check which clan he has an affinity towards. So taking a page from Jiraiya's life he started doing the same thing knowing this could be very dangerous but then again his name was Uzumaki Naruto. While doing the hand signs for the summoning jutsu, he chanted only one thing in his mind "Not the toads" because he knew that if he popped up on Mount Miyoboku his life would be, in short words, fucked, completely fucked. Since the toads were allied to Jiraiya and Jiraiya to Konoha using Euclid's Axiom (not that Naruto knew about Euclid or his Axioms) Toads were allied to Konoha. So if he reached there he would very well get deported to Konoha making his escape a big fail.
With that in mind he drew his blood required for summoning and then went through the hands signs Boar Dog Bird Monkey Ram (in order), then slammed his hands to the ground while saying 'summoning jutsu' which is where a seal matrix appeared and in a he disappeared.
As this happened Naruto had still one thing in mind 'NOT THE TOADS', once he reappeared somewhere the smoke cleared and he was in some kind of a jungle. As the smoke cleared it was more obvious he was in a jungle. Without much in his mind, he went forward exploring the jungle. One thing that was very peculiar for him about the jungle is its uncanny resemblance with the training ground 44 also known as the forest of death or Anko's stomping grounds in his village. Keeping the thoughts aside he went deep inside the forest and was thankful about not having giant bugs or rouge snakes in the jungle as the events of chuunin exams resurfaced in his mind, causing an involuntary shudder.
As he was going inside the forest he saw a quicksand. Looking towards the center of the quicksand, a small indent on the surface of the quicksand made him realize whoever it was, was already drowning in the sand and would meet their death in a matter of moments. It felt scared and helpless and Naruto had to help whatever it was.
By channeling the chakra at the bottom of his feet Naruto ran across the quicksand towards its center and channeled the chakra into his arms to give him more strength before he put his hands into the quicksand and wrapped around whoever was sinking.
With great strength, he fought against the quicksand and pulled whoever it was out.
He stumbled back a little and landed on his butt. He took a deep breath since he had to use more strength than he thought he would against the quicksand, something many shinobi hated since there were very few ways to get out of it.
Whoever it was in the quicksand was very small, so small in fact that if he squeezed them any tighter then they might have popped. He looked down to see the person he just saved.
Though who he saved was not a person at all.
Looking down he saw it was a small cat, so tiny in fact that he could probably put her on top of his head. The little cat was completely white and had black stripes all over its body. Its paws were tiny, almost as tiny as a baby's hand. A pair of sharp teeth was protruding from its mouth.
"Hey there little guy. What are you doing in a big scary place like this?" He said as the little cat opened its eyes to reveal big green eyes looking back at him with a cat slit-like pupil looking back at him.
It stared at him for a moment before it let out a small meow and licked his cheek affectionately making him laugh a little.
"HA HA that tickles little fella." He said as he patted its head.
"Thanks, you mister. I thought I was going to die." The little cat said making Naruto look at it in surprise.
"You talk?" He asked as it bopped its head up and down.
"Yuh huh of course I talk."
"Wells that's pretty cool. I have never met a talking cat before. Talking toads and slugs yes but never a little cat."
He guessed he said something wrong because the little cat began hitting its tiny paws against him while it made a facial expression that he guessed was a pout.
"I'm not a cat you big dummy. I'm a tiger, a white tiger from the White Tiger clan. And stop calling me fella, I'm a girl." The little tiger revealed making Naruto look at her in surprise.
"Oh well, I am sorry about that." He said before he put his hand out to her. "My name is Naruto. It's nice to meet you." He said as the little tiger cub looked at him with her big green eyes before she copied his motions and placed her paw on top of his hand.
"My name is Kohaku, part of the White Tiger Clan." She said as Naruto nodded and stood he walked away from the quicksand with Kohaku still in his arms.
He held her close so that she did not fall back into the quicksand and he gently stroked her beautiful coat of fur, removing bits of sand from it as he did.
"You know I don't think I have ever heard of a White Tiger Clan before," Naruto said. "I am aware of the Toads, Snakes, Slugs, Monkeys, and Dogs but White Tigers are a new one to me."
Kohaku moved her little head to look up at him.
"Kaa-san doesn't like our kind going out in the world too much. She says long ago people killed the small Tigers for sport and lots of us died. So Kaa-san wants us to stay in our homeland since it is safe there and no one can hurt us."
Naruto smiled. "Your Kaa-san sounds very smart and she sounds like she cared a lot for her family."
Kohaku bobbed her head. "She is and she is very powerful. Kaa-san is the chief of the White Tiger Clan. A lot of the other Tigers are a little scared of her since she is very strong. But I think Kaa-san is a big softie."
'Yeah, I bet.' Naruto thought.
"If you are not allowed usually allowed to leave your home then why are you in this forest?" He asked.
Kohaku gave him a very toothy smile. "Kaa-san says I'm a very curious child and I always want to see what's outside of home. But Kaa-san likes it when I'm close by since I am Mama's only cub."
"So she's very protective over you." He said as Kohaku nodded.
"Very so she might be a little mad that I am out here," she said before she jumped out of Naruto's arms. "You should meet her. I think she would like you since you saved me!"
"I don't think that would be a good idea." He said waving his arms but Kohaku did not listen and placed her paw on the ground in front of them. As she did, a black marking appeared on the ground, and Naruto recognized the summoning seals.
A second later a large cloud of smoke appeared and it made Naruto very nervous. He thought the cloud would be small, about a man's size or bigger but instead, it was enormous, covering parts of the forest, and went far over the tops of the trees.
'Oh, crap.' He thought hoping that Kohaku's mother would not turn him into 'cat' food.
As the cloud began to disappear, Naruto unconsciously took a step back, and for good reason.
The creature in front of him was the very definition of enormous. She towered over the tree's tops and if he had to guess, he would say that she was even bigger than Gamabunta, at least a good head taller.
Her fur was like Kohaku's, snow white with long black stripes over her body but her coat had a shine that he guessed came with age. Her eyes were jade green as well and the claws on her paws were even bigger than his mother's. On the top of her head was what looked like some kind of tiara with an emerald in the center of it and her tail and shoulder muscles had this greyish silver armour to it.
The enormous White Tiger looked around in confusion. "Where am I?" she called out in a strong but very elegant-sounding voice. The voice had nobility laced all over it.
"Kaa-san down here!" Kohaku's squeaky voice called and at first, he wondered if the giant Tiger would even be able to her. But she did when her large head looked down and towards Kohaku.
"Kohaku." She said in a stern voice as her head lowered down to the ground to look at her daughter. "What have I told you about leaving Mount Taigahiru? You know I don't like you leaving our home without me knowing or at all."
Kohaku stood up on her hind legs, which would have reached to Naruto's knee, against her mother's enormous nose. "But Kaa-san it's so boring at home. And I met a new friend. See?" She said looking over at Naruto whose eyes went a little wide as the enormous eyes of the White Tiger chief moved towards him and narrowed.
A deep growl came out of her throat that made the area vibrate and Naruto could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
"Did this person hurt you my little cub?" She asked as the mother Tiger rose to its full height making Naruto wonder if anyone else from the village could see the enormous Tiger since he doubted anyone could ever miss her.
Naruto gulped and readied himself to defend himself if possible but Kohaku leaped in front of Naruto and looked at her mother with a pout on her face. "Kaa-san please don't hurt him. He saved me. I might have died if he had not arrived."
The great tiger looked a little put back when her daughter spoke before her eyes narrowed again and went back down to look at Kohaku's.
"Start explaining daughter," she said though it sounded more like a command.
So Kohaku began to explain what had happened, how she fell into quicksand as she chased a butterfly around and drowned in it when Naruto arrived and took her out of the sand before it could completely engulf her.
Naruto stood to the side as the mother tiger scolded her little cub for foolish actions before her giant nose touched Kohaku's body.
"I thought I might have lost you." She said softly as Kohaku stood on her hind legs again and licked her mother's nose in comfort.
Naruto smiled. She is just a mother worried about her child.
The giant Tiger moved her head and looked towards Naruto before she stood at her full height again making Naruto take a gulp. No words were spoken momentarily as the mighty White Tiger chief boss looked down at Naruto with her large green eyes gazing right into him.
After a moment of silence, she spoke.
"Saving my daughter as you did has put you in a favorable light and your actions have gained my thanks, young man. Few would dare to risk saving another from death, less likely counting we are of different species. For saving my daughter, you have my thanks. I am Shirotora, Chief of the White Tiger Clan of Mount Taigahiru."
Knowing to be polite in this situation, Naruto bowed to the giant White Tiger leader. "I am Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze. It's nice to meet you." He said as Shirotora nodded to him.
"You will have to forgive my earlier rudeness to you young cub, my kind have had bad experiences with humanity so we tend to avoid interaction with them. You are the first human I have spoken to in many decades."
"He is real nice Kaa-san. He cleaned me and got rid of the sand." Kohaku said as she showed her mother her clean fur.
"It was no problem at all Shirotora-sama. I was just glad that I could help and save your daughter when I did. If not then I dread to think what might have happened."
Shirotora nodded her head and was about to speak when Kohaku was waving her paws in the air, trying to get her attention.
"Kaa-san we should reward him. I know how we can reward him. It is the best idea I have ever had." She said as Naruto chuckled at the little cub while Shirotora rolled her eyes but smiled a big toothy smile showing her large sharp teeth.
"What is your idea young one?"
Kohaku gave her a big smile and padded over to Naruto as she rubbed her head against his leg purring before answering.
"Let him become our summoner and sign the White Tiger Contract." She said as both Naruto and Shirotora looked at her in surprise.
Naruto did not have any words to say though inwardly he was bursting with happiness. He wanted to have summons that were not toads and they were giving him a chance.
Shirotora meanwhile narrowed her eyes to look at her daughter and Kohaku.
"Kohaku, might I remind you we have never had a summoner before? Why should we start now?"
Kohaku frowned. "But Kaa-san this could be a good way to get back into this world, plus Naruto would be a good summoner. Right?" She asked as Naruto quickly nodded his head.
Shirotora stood tall as she looked down at Naruto with her piercing green eyes staring intently into him, almost as if she was staring into his very soul and trying to see if he was worthy enough to be their first summoner.
"Hmm. Young one come with us to Taigahiru there the real test will commence to see if you are a worthy summoner or not." Then he was again pulled through space and time to a mountain this time it was filled with tigers. As they were they went inside there was a giant cave where the trio entered it. Then as they went inside Shirotora called someone "MA"
Naruto now anticipatingly waited for this 'Ma' person, then of one of the gates came a small bipedal tiger with a cane in hand, "Oh! Shiro-chan, Ko-chan!" as she came closer she suddenly left upwards in the air surprising all of them and then suddenly Naruto felt intense pain on his head by a cane and then his vision gradually went black. "Human be gone!" she yelled.
"Ma! What the hell?!" Shirotora exclaimed.
"What you know, he is a human and you know what humans have done with us don't you" Ma replied.
"But he helped me!" Kohaku butted in. This piqued Ma's curiosity.
"Explain," She said authoritatively, she might be an old tigress, but she would be damned if tigers did not respect her. Then Kohaku and Shirotora started explaining what happened from Kohaku getting trapped in a quicksand to Shirotora considering him a summoner. "So you want to have him as a summoner"
"Yes ma"
"Hmm okay Shiro-chan, do not take the second test."
"Why Ma?"
"He saving Kohaku was enough. Take him to my house I will take the first test and then tell you."
After settling him into her house, she made some hand signs with her paws, and then put her hand on his head and closed her eyes after some time Naruto opened his eyes to see the tigress that hit him in front of him.
"Ah don't worry Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze, son of Kushina Uzumaki and Minato Namikaze, I mean no harm, Myself Baatora."
"Well action speaks louder than words, but did you know about my parents."
"Ah, that is due to a jutsu that lets me see your memories. Nifty don't you think?"
"What do you exactly want?"
"To ask you a simple question?"
"Ask away."
"If you have a family, a wife, and children and you still lived in Konoha who would you have given preference to."
It did not even take Naruto a second before answering, "Family, I am not going to repeat the same mistake made by my father."
Baatora got the answer she required. Tigers are a proud clan, pride in always protecting their family and pride in selflessness and bravery, all the qualities this human in front of her had shown so she made her decision.
"Child, come with me."
As they left the cave, after walking outside they met with the mother-daughter duo, "So ma what is your decision?" Shirotora asked.
"Well, how about bring out the summoning scroll sound like?" She asked cheekily, and all of them smiled knowing she passed the test.
Shirotora looked down towards Kohaku and gave her a small nod which made the little cub bounce in happiness before she placed her paw on the ground and another poof went out, though this time was only a tiny one.
Out of the smoke was a large scroll, about the size of the one Jiraiya carried on his back for the Toads. It was grey and on each end had a silver tiger head while the Kanji for White Tiger was written on the side.
"Open it up," Shirotora said to Naruto who quickly nodded and did so. He opened up the scroll to show long empty columns, once again proving that they had never had any summoners before.
'Cool.' He thought as he went down to his knees and looked the scroll over as Kohaku sat beside him and Shirotora looked over him. Then Naruto knew what to do as he took his right thumb and bit into the skin. He saw a tiny bit of blood flow out of the wounds and quickly began to write his name into the scroll. After a few moments, he took his hand away and looked at the scroll that now had his name written in the first column.
"And that's it," Shirotora said as the name glowed for a moment before it turned black, now permanently becoming part of the scroll. "You are now officially the first summoner of the White Tiger Summons. Don't disappoint us." She warned as Naruto quickly nodded though he had a big smile plastered on his face.
"Kohaku, since this was your idea, you will be the boy's familiar."
Kohaku happily nodded before she jumped up and climbed on Naruto until she sat comfortably on his head while an amused Naruto looked up at her. After spending some time there he summoned himself to the house he was living in not before promising Kohaku that he would spend more time with her. (I mean how can someone deny something to such a cute kitty, I am sure will not.)
As he reappeared inside the Ghosh House, It had been about 4 to 5 hours in his journey. During that time Dhriti was frantically searching the house and locality while remaining as less suspicious as one could be. Then when she saw Naruto and ran towards him and hugged the life out of him, "{where were you Naruto? Did you know how worried I was?}" She exclaimed. In his usual cold tone he said "{it is none of your business}", this time something snapped in Dhriti, "{none of my business huh, I tore down the whole locality for you and none of my business!}" She raised her voice.
This snapped Naruto and in a raised voice he said, "{Why the hell do you care?!}" This enraged Dhriti, "{Why the hell do I care? I saved your life and then nursed it that is why!}" Naruto then replied in a snarky way, "{yeah let me guess! You did it out of pity, poor child no one to care for him, let me do it so he can become eternally grateful about it.}" This comment genuinely hurt Dhriti and it could be seen on her face as she yelled "{go to your room!}"
While they separated from each other, they were contemplating their words, Dhriti regretted that she took a hot approach to it while Naruto regretted his words after seeing the genuine hurt on her face. After some hours pass by while Naruto is resting a bit, his door opens which he senses to be Dhriti.
Dhriti, after contemplating for a bit thought to have a heart-to-heart dialogue with Naruto so when she opened the door and saw Naruto resting she decided to tell him a bit about her. "{Naruto I know you are listening, you know I had a son of your age when our relationship deteriorated after my husband's death. He also acted a lot like you, when I thought I could reconcile with him, everything was too late. He died in a terrorist attack. After I saw you, I saw myself having a shot at redemption. I know somewhere I was wrong and for what It's worth I am sorry.}" Dhriti tried to stand up Naruto caught the corner of her saree.
Dhriti had been right about one thing, he had been listening, so when he listened to her, he found out she was as broken as he was and this truly made him a lot guilty, as she tried to stand up he grabbed hold of the corner of her saree and then sat by her. He spoke up in a meek voice, "{you know the experience has built a lot of trust issues in me and I did not know who to trust anymore and judged you without thinking twice. I am sorry! Please forgive me!}" In return he got a hug from her as she said, "{Idiot! How can I not? The elders always must guide the younger and forgive and rectify their mistakes. So all is forgiven, now can we start a new chapter in our life with trust in it.}" She got a nod in response. Happy with that she walked towards the door, when she again got interrupted by Naruto,
"{Um Dhriti}" she turned around to listen to him, "{I do not know the level of trust we will be able to build moving forward, so in advance may I ask that can I be your grandson?}" In response Dhriti just opened her arms wide, Naruto getting the signal latched onto that hug like his lifeline as they accepted each other as grandmother and grandson.
That day Naruto also learned a valuable lesson that would help in his entire life, that there are two parts to every story.

Ghosh House
As night was deep both of them slept in their respective rooms since the emotions were still high and they were fatigued after all the shenanigans forgetting their dinner as they much wanted rest rather than food. The next morning, when the sun was on the horizon, Naruto woke up. It was a habit of his, to wake at the break of dawn to start his day. That day was also one of them, but after a bit of freshening up, he fully woke up. This time having a smile on his face, knowing the old woman who he was currently staying with, he could trust her to a degree. He was not going to tell all about his life including his tenant. Speaking of his tenant, last night, during his sleep when he visited his tenant he was fast asleep, making it 2nd week it was asleep.
With that thought process going in his mind, he went on the roof to start exercising. From what he could assess of his body, his strength and stamina had greatly decreased after the accident, even with the kyuubi's chakra healing him, the fatigue was still there. So, he started on the strength and stamina building slowly as his current level was that of a civilian and he wanted to go back to his previous strength.
With his entire workout routine done, he came down from the roof after three hours to meet Dhriti who was awake. "{Oh you are awake! Good morning Naruto.}" Dhriti said in a peppy voice while Naruto had one thing in mind, "{How the hell is she so peppy after what happened?!}" Then he greeted her back, "{Good morning Grandma}" He unintentionally said 'Grandma' and was going to rectify himself when he was interrupted by a smiling Dhriti who said, "{Well, then what would you like for breakfast, my grandson.}" These couple of words moved him. He used to call Tsunade Grandma as a term of endearment with no real attachment to that role while with Dhriti his subconscious mind wanted someone he could lean on and share his troubles with like a family member.
A smiling Naruto then followed her to the kitchen. "{Hey if you don't mind, can I help you here?}"
"{Yeah sure, the more, the merrier}" She said cheerfully as she did not expect Naruto to call her 'Grandma' so instantly. It warmed her heart and lit a fire to protect him and show him the right way to live.
As she and he started working in the kitchen, she started to request him to bring some ingredients. Some he understood and recognized others were new to him, like 'garam masala' and other stuff. Dhriti saw him interested and then she asked if he was interested in cooking. A flustered Naruto shyly shook his head in a yes. Then she instructed him like she would do to a child. Although he was a bit peeved, he knew he was a novice, so he sucked up his pride (which he begrudgingly agreed he had) and did what he was told. That day they made Roti (a type of bread) and Dal (Pulses) along with Tea.
He got the basics of tea quite easily, while Dhriti did not want him to make the Dal so she helped him in making Roti, which sometimes (a lot of times) he burnt, but in the end, he got decent with the Rotis and made several of them which Dhriti approved of. Then they started plating the food and for the first time, he noticed that they were not eating with chopsticks. While weird he thought since he was in a place far away altogether why not adjust like them?
Once they sat at the dining table, she saw that he was having problems eating (more like tearing the Roti.) with his hands so she helped him again with the eating. This time Dhriti noticed something odd, since she had a master's in psychology and also had been studying in foreign, she noticed his hesitation, which many would chalk up to the fight but for her, it was concerning. Humans do express themselves in a lot of ways, happiness, sadness, jealousy, anger, and remorse. For fights, it's mostly anger and remorse. But the case with Naruto was that he was hesitating to express himself. As if he was expecting rejection. This made her wonder what kind of environment he grew up in.
So she decided to test her theory. She first put less sugar in their tea intentionally, for days while he was here, he always needed more sugar, so she put the sugar to her side to see if he would hesitate to take it. As she thought he did hesitate, so she gave the initiative, "{Sugar}"
"{Yes thank you.}" He said shyly
Then she thought of doing another small but crucial test to hammer the nail in the coffin. She said, "{if you have anything to ask or say then do not hesitate okay grandson?}" The acceptance and relief on his face put the nail in the coffin and then she thought about his condition. While on the table, after eating they started conversing, "{So, Naruto you said you come from the elemental nations, so how are the people there.}"
"{Um guess people are the same without all these fancy machinery, but guess then they do have chakra to replace it.}" This interested Dhriti, so the people are a bit primitive, and this chakra thing interested her. "{So, what is this chakra Naruto?}" She queried to him.
"{Um chakra is like the cool thing we use to do ninja techniques.}" He answered in a half-hazard way since he did not know the definition. He always slept, skipped, or was kicked out of the classes, so he did know word to word of it.
Now Dhriti was intrigued more about this ninja thing, "{So Naruto, are you a ninja?}"
"{Yes, well no um it's a bit complicated.}"
Naruto thought about ways he could explain his situation without giving out much of the crucial parts he wanted to hide but was constantly, meeting a dead end. Seeing his hesitation she quickly said, "{you don't have to tell me right now, so anyways did you have school back there?}"
"{Yes we did have shinobi academy and civilian schools}" He said and then started explaining it and his experience in the academy, Dhriti noticed something about the answer that he was neglected or a better word ostracized but he was not explaining why was he ostracized, as if said why, she will start to do the same also. Since he did not want to speak about the topic, she did not poke her nose in it. She knew when to stop, unlike other people.
"{Hey if it's okay for you discuss what exactly happened between you and your son.}" He asked in an attempt to steer the conversation away and also to have some answers. As if to help his attempt she started explaining everything from her husband's death to her deteriorating relationship then him converting his religion officially breaking their relationship. "{Then the last knowing news I had of him was his death and my granddaughter's existence.}" This kind of shocked Naruto.
"{Wait granddaughter!}" He exclaimed.
"{Didn't I tell you about her?}" Dhriti asked, Naruto shook his head indicating a no to the posed question, "{Oh! Must have slipped my mind! Tehee!}" She said as she stuck her tongue out and winked and bonked her head, "{what the hell is this old woman?}" He thought with a sweat drop forming on the back of his head. (Clearly, Naruto hadn't met a woman from Delhi.)
"{Grandma could you tell more about her}" He asked and then he realized he shouldn't have asked said question when he saw the obsessed look on her face as she started rambling about her granddaughter. "{Oh she is an absolute munchkin…}" He tuned her out only listening to her for the important part, such as her name is Shrishti Ghosh, she goes to a boarding school for good quality of education and she is in third grade.
"{Hey don't mind me asking what is a boarding school and third grade?}" He asked her while interrupting her praise speech, when she heard the question, she felt like hitting herself for not explaining to him about the education system.
Then she started explaining about the Indian education system, about exams and marks along with the classes from nursery to 12th grade then she said, "{Naruto what is your age?}" He replied "{Thirteen and will be turning 14 on 10th October.}"
"{So that means you would be in 8th grade hmm. And then there is that.}"
"{Um. What is what?}" He asked not liking the tone. She looked sheepish, and then she started explaining about the certain 'there is that'.
"{Well you see that um...}"
"{See what?}" It looked like the roles had reversed, as Naruto became the 'parent' and Dhriti became the 'child'.
"{When you came here, on the shores. I picked you up and then got you to the hospital, I told them that you are my grandson, so, you get it right?}" Dhriti said in a strained tone.
"{When you mean, I am your grandson, Am I your 'biological' grandson?}" She just nodded, making Naruto despair, "{So, I am your illegitimate or step-grandson right?}" She nodded.
"{Yeah, somewhat like that}" She said then he queried, "{so how is this going to work?}"
"{Well, I did say that my son aka your 'supposed' father met your imaginary mother in the US and had you. Then they separated you grew up in the US and lost your mother 4 years ago and father 3 years ago, then you found me and are here to stay. Then there was an accident so you are right now recovering.}" She explained
"{Hey Dhriti what is the US?}" She was asked by him. She felt like again hitting herself. Then she started explaining how this part of the world works. Naruto was nothing short of fascinated with this part of the world, Like the western part of the world how some part speak English some, Spanish then how there are seven continents in the world and the world maps and all the things. As Naruto was thinking all about it he had an idea. Recently he had the secret of shadow clone discovered by him. When dispelled, A shadow clone can give back the clone's memories to the creator of said clone. It is known as a forbidden jutsu, due to the amount of chakra required and fatigue due to memory feedback, chakra requirement was not an issue thanks to his tenant but the memory part of it was still an uncharted territory so he had to wait for that. In theory, he could just get help from his shadow clones to learn a language faster so, he would work on that for right now.
"{And for the fact you have two months in hand for this learning stuff.}" Dhriti mumbled but was heard by Naruto, "{what do you mean by two months?}" he asked.
"{Oh right you don't know, well you see my granddaughter is in third grade in a boarding school, and will come in two months for her summer break here, before you ask summer break is during June when they get holiday for a month due to the heat and rest with their families and all. So we have to prepare you to meet her okay?}" She said.
"{Okay so I have two months to be ready for her when she meets her brother from another mother.}" He said for which she chuckled and nodded, "{well grandma I just have a jutsu for this occasion.}"
"{What kind of this jutsu is it?}" She asked, but instead of telling her he did the jutsu, he formed an all too familiar hand sign and then another Naruto popped up shocking Dhriti to the core. But Naruto was not done, "{Grandma goes with him and tells him anything secretly so that I cannot hear it and then hit him hard to pop him.}" Seeing her hesitance, he encouraged and assured her by telling her it was okay and to trust him.
So, she went with the clone and after some time he got the memory of the clone, and then Dhriti came back. "{So, 5th November, huh, your birthday.}" This shocked Dhriti to the core "{but how?}" Then it hit her, "{Say Naruto how I popped him?}" his reply was, "{you hit on the head hard.}" Then it clicked for her. "{What are they exactly?}"
"{Oh they are my clones.}"
"{So these clones of yours, when popped share their memory with their creator.}" She deduced and Naruto nodded agreeing to her deduction of the clone's mechanism. "{Yes, Shadow Clone Jutsu is a forbidden jutsu of my village due to the amount of chakra and memory feedback. The chakra would not be a problem but I am not sure about memory feedback.}" She nodded about it and then she said, "{We will figure something out about it, but first go, take a bath while I clean up stuff, and then we figure the memory problem out okay?}" Naruto nodded and left to take a bath while Dhriti cleaned up the table and went to do some other chores around the house.
As everything was done, he took a bath and her doing the household chores, after that, they again met in the kitchen where Naruto helped Dhriti with the cooking, and they ate rice and vegetable curry. As they ate the food Naruto for the first time tried eating with his hands, as expected it was hard but with Dhriti helping him it was a bit better.
After eating, Naruto helped Dhriti in cleaning the dining table and then did the dishes. As they did all the chores, they both went into another room. "{Ok, Naruto let's get started with the memory experiment. Wait a minute.}" She then started rummaging through what looked like a book cupboard and then she came out with a roughed-up book. "{Naruto these are some Japanese stories I want you to create 5 clones.}" He wordlessly did what he was told. And once they were formed Dhriti handed each one of them one story then she told them, "{Go out of the room and read the stories and memories it and dispel the clones.}" Each of the clones nodded and went out of the room.
Once they were done, they came back and handed her the stories. She then commanded them to dispel themselves one by one at intervals of 5 seconds, which confused Naruto but he trusted her so he gave all of the green light, to listen to her command. Seeing their creator giving them the green light, they did what they were told. Once all clones were popped Dhriti then turned towards Naruto. "{Naruto recall the lines you learned.}" He then recalled all the lines his clones were given with ease. So she repeated the process with 10 clones. He again did it but this time with a slight hiccup. When the experiment was done with 15 clones he was getting a bit of a problem, same with 20 clones. But with 25 clones he very much struggled to memorize the lines along with a severe headache.
So it was decided they would use 20 clones for learning. "{Well it's almost evening, let's eat, and then you rest while I make a learning planner}" Dhriti said and Naruto agreed as he was also exhausted so they ate and he went to sleep. Dhriti was still awake, she was ecstatic after knowing about the jutsu while a bit envious of him, thinking about all the things she could get done. So, now she had to make a routine to teach Naruto English enough to make Shrishti believe that he was her brother. Along with English, there are other subjects also. So she got to the planning and teaching, so she got working on her side of things.
Morning rolled up, Naruto woke up and after doing his morning rituals, he went into the kitchen and saw Dhriti was already there making breakfast in the kitchen. "{Good morning grandma.}" He greeted her. Seeing him, she smiled and greeted him, "{Good morning to you too.}" And then they made breakfast together, and both of them were relaxed a lot. As they ate breakfast they started to discuss their schedule for the upcoming weeks, "{Naruto, so we will start your lessons from today.}" He nodded and then replied, "{Okay, so how are we doing it?}"
"{Finish eating and then meet me in the study room.}" He nodded and they continued eating in relative silence. As they finished breakfast, both started to clean and proceeded to go to the study room, once there Dhriti spoke, "{Okay Naruto make 20 clones and then divide them into groups of ten.}" He did what he was told, then Dhriti brought twenty pieces of paper and gave two to each one of them and then instructed them, "{You lot, you have to just trace the characters given on the sheet and trace it about 10 to 50 times.}" They started to groan but one look from Dhriti set them straight while she was proud inwardly that her glare still had power.
As the group of ten went to another room to practice, the group with Dhriti along with the original Naruto saw a big blackboard in front of them, now Naruto (original) started groaning inwardly, thinking that it would be another boring lecture but was brought out of his thought when Dhriti started speaking, "{Everyone, I want you to repeat exactly what I say and pronounce, also try remembering the images given here.}" The Dhriti drew two symbols one of which was round and had a tail at its back while the other was a triangle with two of its sides extended. She said, "{this is 'A' repeat after me 'A'.}" So they repeated, then she said pointing to the former symbol, "{this is small 'a' while this is capital 'A'}" pointing towards the other symbol. The original raised his hand, and she nodded to him, "{so, why are there two symbols for the same thing}" She nodded and then said, "{I will tell you later but right now just learn them.}" He nodded back satisfied with the answer.
Then the session resumed for 6 hours (or 6 freaking long hours in Naruto's words) long, with Dhriti introducing Naruto to small and capital alphabets and the other team just continuously tracing the paper 42 times. Dhriti was satisfied then said, "{good work everyone, I am very proud of you all}" They all had brightened smiles on their faces, and then she continued, "{with the tracing group, I need you all to dispel one by one until one of you is left.}" It took them three minutes to do it as they went from 10 to 5 to 3 to 1. She smiled, and then she said the same command to the other group, and then they did the same thing until there were three Narutos left, "{I now want the one to dispel who was here}" the mentioned clone jot the message and dispelled while Naruto got the 6-hour long lecture 10 more times, then Dhriti instructed the other to dispel then he suddenly got another bunch of memories.
"{Okay Naruto now I want you to write all the letters in two pages one for small and another for capital.}" She said and he took the two pages and started writing, after about 20 minutes he gave her the papers and she motioned him to stand by her as she corrected his papers, it honestly astonished her that what children took three years he did it in merely 6 hours, this shadow clone jutsu was very handy as not only it transfers visual memories but muscle memories. He got 42 out of 52 right and was wrong at only places where the majority would be wrong. Dhriti then praised him and showed him where he was wrong. This made Naruto happy as no one in his shinobi academy praised him and was always sent out due the prejudice against him. If Dhriti was his shinobi teacher, he would have tried the hardest to get rookie of the year, so, that he could make her proud.
While he was thinking, Dhriti had other thoughts, Naruto was not a genius she would say that surely he was not book smarts but he had one thing that would make him a bloody genius, it was his hard work and determination, it was all that was required to be able to learn but then other thing stroked her, she recalled that Naruto was the dead last from their conversations, as the joined the clues, she concluded that he was sabotaged. Now this was becoming a big conspiracy for her, questions like, why was he sabotaged or what was the reason for the ostracizing to the point that they would be sabotaged? These questions plagued her mind but were shot down as she had faith in Naruto that when he was ready he would come clean. She then saw that Naruto had left his notebook there so, she went to give Naruto his notebook. "{Naruto you forgot your-}" As she was speaking she froze at the site before her.
A Few Moments Before
As Naruto was going to his room after Dhriti corrected the papers, he today felt something that he never felt before, acceptance, as the feeling came and it was gone as he thought about her reaction when he told her about Kyuubi. As he was thinking this he entered his room where he met an all too familiar face.
"Kohaku what are you doing here?" He asked shocked seeing the tiger summon his room
"You were not visiting me-us for three days so I came here, and I am not talking to you humph!" She said in a voice that aroused Naruto's urge to cuddle and pet her. Instead, he asked her.
"And your mother allowed you to visit here?" He was amused to see her reaction, as she puffed her chest and said, "Yes, I told Mommy" Then she realized she again answered him, "Hey I am not talking to you." She pouted as he smiled and said.
"Ok, look, I am sorry Kohaku for not visiting for so long but right now, it is a bit impossible due to some things, so I will be busy for three months after that promise."
She thought and then innocently asked, "Promise?" Naruto, if someone read his mind, had only one thought, "SO CUTE!" and he just nodded, immediately her demeanor changed as she smiled brightly and started rambling but then it came to a stop which got Naruto's attention, "Hey Naruto who is that old lady there?" she asked with a cute head tilt.
Present Time
As Dhriti entered the room, she was shocked to see a talking cat, "{Naruto is that cat talking?}" pointing towards Kohaku. As expected, Kohaku got triggered for being called a cat. "{Hey old lady, who are you calling a cat, I am a tiger, a freaking tiger, and should I spell it for you T-I-G-E-R tiger.}" She shouted at Dhriti. Naruto seeing this was amused beyond anything but he broke the conversation before it could get into a full-blown argument. "{Enough Kohaku, she did not know about you.}" Placating the tiger.
"{Grandma this is my summon.}" He started.
"{Summon?}"
"{Ah yes, you don't know about summoning jutsu, right?}"
"{No.}"
With that he started explaining to her about summoning jutsu, "{so, this summoning jutsu, lets you summon any kind of animal you are in contract with for your blood?}" He nods. "{And you are in contract with tigers?}" Another nod. She also nods showing that he understood the situation. "{So, can I pet her?}" She asked. He looked at Kohaku while she nodded telling her, she was okay with it. The moment she touched her fingers on Kohaku, she felt an electric shock throughout her body and then was immediately sent into a state of euphoria, purring loudly like a cat. Dhriti just smiled at that.
"{Hey grandma.}" Naruto caught Dhriti's attention. "{Yes?}" She replied.
"{Do you know how to read and write kanji?}"
"{Yes, I believe I do so, why?}"
"{Could you help me with it?}"
"{Of course, why not?}" She smiled at the happy Naruto who heard her.
Thus, they resumed their learning journey, now with their house tiger. As Kohaku just loved getting pampered by Dhriti and also seeing Naruto getting tortured by her so, she started coming over regularly. She always snickers whenever she sees him getting a headache and this results in him giving a stink eye towards her. Also during this time, Naruto had been affected in two areas, mental and dietary. When Dhriti learned about his diet, she became enraged and gave him a whole lecture on diet. And then started changing it, which made a difference in his physical abilities as he was getting taller and building more muscles.
Also during this time, she discovered that the ostracizing was not only in education but also in food, this raised serious red flags in Dhriti's head about Naruto's upbringing, as being an orphan is one thing, but being ostracized along with being an orphan causes a lot of mental health issue. That is why her concern for him was raised.
The following weeks were the proof of what an intelligent person who could use their mind can do. Naruto's learning skyrocketed, their initial plan was only to teach him English but with the liberal use of shadow clones, it skyrocketed, like never before.
In the first week after the first day, Naruto was learning rapidly. For the first three days, he managed to get the English alphabet down, which was followed by the next four days of him mastering words and their formation. Thankfully there was a dictionary helping him to learn more. Some words confused him like 'honesty'. Also, the homophones and homonyms confused him but he pulled through it. Next week, Naruto started to form sentences and learn about other parts of speech. This was followed by Dhriti helping him with his kanji writing, by now he could say that he had good, legible handwriting, both in kanji and English.
By the third week, Naruto could write and speak decent English, not as fluent as the foreigners but enough to convince the uneducated and a third-grade student. It did help that he was determined to do what was necessary, going into the house library to read different books, and watching English films on the television. This helped with the accent now if he spoke English, it would be as if an American spoke, and when he switches to Japanese as if he is a native of Japan. During this time she also had to fix his Japanese. It helps when you have friends around the world. As Naruto spoke Japanese, it was as if a high-class diplomat was speaking.
The fourth week saw Naruto speaking fluent English without any flaws grammatically whatsoever, most would call it a miracle but those who know the behind-the-scenes, meaning Dhriti and Kohaku, know the hard work behind the scenes. The first major roadblock was Naruto's hate for learning. It was the most difficult part was to get Naruto to settle down to study. It took a lot of punishment and beatdowns (which were a source of entertainment for Kohaku) to get him started.
In a month Naruto went from not speaking English to holding daily conversations in the house and their medium of conversation also changed to English. The funny thing about this was that Kohaku learned a bit of English too. And the other day her mother popped into their house thinking about, what the hell was her daughter learning. She met with Dhriti and cleared all the queries too. From a Shinobi standpoint, she found Kohaku speaking English beneficial. This would give them the edge on the battlefield as no one would know what they were planning.
The next month saw Naruto getting on with the other subjects. By this time he could speak excellent English and now started speaking broken Bengali, along with knowing fifth-grade subjects enough to make him look like a foreign student with the knowledge of a fifth-grader to fool a third-grader. Now all that was required was to make Shrishti believe that she had a step-brother and he came here after hearing their father's death and to hide his real identity. But the most crucial part was to see how she would react to this situation.
While this was going through Dhriti's mind Naruto was thinking something else, for him, Dhriti was a godsend person. She explained things so beautifully that for the first time in his life, he wanted to learn new things that were not 'cool jutsus'. Speaking of jutsus, he did not know what to think of his homeland. Dhriti's mentoring helped him to see through some of his glaring mistakes. Sure, she was an old woman, but she was nothing like Sandaime, that man always directed him to be a pacifist and forgive even in the face of unfair treatment while Dhriti taught him to stand up for unfair treatment and helped him by mentally healing him. Turns out he was mentally stunted and, thus was socially awkward. He regularly thanked her for helping him see his real self thus he made up his mind that after Shrishti leaves he will tell her about the fox.
Meanwhile in Elemental Nations
In a dark cave, 10 holograms were standing in front of a wooden statue with 9 eyes. "Zetsu, why have you called us here?" A person with spiky hair and a deep voice said. "Leader-sama-" "It turns out the nine tails jinchuuriki is missing."
"What do you mean by missing?"
"He could not be found in Konoha, most probably [He] is away with Jiraiya of the Sannin."
"Hmm... I see." Then he continued,
"Zetsu find out his exact location and report and the rest of you, gather finances and create spies, we will meet again in three years to complete our goal and will start with the Kyuubi."
"Hai! Leader-Sama!" The rest said and the holograms disappeared.
The atmosphere in the ROOT base was the same but not for leader Danzo Shimura, as he read the reports they stated that they could not find the Kyuubi Jinchuuriki. "Run Jinchuuriki, run and hide all you can but I will find you for the good oh Konoha." Danzo thought.
In Konohagakure
A week after the disappearance of one Naruto Uzumaki, queries about his whereabouts started to come in, and thanks to the foresight they were able to tackle it with ease. First, it started with the last member of team seven. Due to the nature of the blast, no one except for the Black ops, the Retrieval Squad, and the Hokage knew about it, and the information on this was kept tight shut. The council meeting happened but due to Naruto going rogue or as the council knew Naruto going on a training trip with Jiraiya of the Sannin, their plans to banish him were foiled.
Next, when Sakura asked about his whereabouts to Kakashi, she was given the answer that was ordered to be given, and from Sakura, the news reached her best friend Ino Yamanaka from where the word spread to the Rookie 9 and Team Gai. Reactions were that for Sakura it was that she went to Tsunade to be an apprentice under her, when asked why, she answered she did not want to drag her team down, which made Tsunade think that there was still hope in the fangirl which immediately crushed by the next statement that was so that she and Naruto could bring back Sasuke.
That did it for her as she wanted to scream at that girl to break her out of her fantasies. But then she accepted her knowing how weak they were and that they needed powerful shinobis. Since the girl was a blank canvas, she could just mold her into a capable shinobi along with some other kunoichis. From what she read Sakura along with Ino Yamanaka and Hinata Hyuuga were chosen. In Tsunade's mind, she could just straighten these three up. Breaking both the girls out of their Fangirlish phases and raising the Hyuuga's confidence.
While she was thinking this, her peers were receiving the news. Team Gai took it well as Rock Lee determined to catch up to Naruto while Neji thought about how would his cousin take the news. Team Eight on the other hand had a different reaction, Shino Aburame took the logical point of the side, and Kiba Inuzuka started a jealous rant while Hinata Hyuuga was downtrodden not being able to say goodbye to her secret yet not-so-secret crush. Team Ten had a different reaction Choji Akimichi was sad that he could not say goodbye to his friend, and Shikamaru Nara was a bit suspicious while Ino Yamanaka got the news from Sakura already.
Over these months several changes happened. Kakashi went back to his recluse life blaming himself for their defection. For Tsunade on the other hand, it was a wake-up call to take things seriously and she did the same. From now on she did take meetings and diplomacy with paperwork like a veteran shinobi not like an alcoholic. Her relationship with Jiraiya did mend as he became her unofficial advisor.
Jiraiya on the other hand was worried as the given time of six months was running out and he still could not find Naruto. One fortunate thing was that Akatsuki hadn't started their hunt yet. So he still had time before they caught up. Jiraiya thought of using his summons so he had to come clean. Once he did, the backlash was surely there but they were helpful too, although one thing he noticed was that during each of his conversations with the sages, they would whisper about something called a veil. But he did not prod in their matter. All that was going on in his mind was his grandson's safety.
In West Bengal, India
Not knowing what the situation was after his departure, Naruto was at the Sealdah Railway Station along with Dhriti waiting for his 'Step-Sister'. Not knowing about the havoc she was going to cause him in the upcoming years.
Shrishti Arundhuti Ghosh was a blessed child or so she thought. Growing up in a well-off family, she never had to care about trivial things like how to afford basic amenities. No that was taken care of. She lived in a posh area of Bombay, spoiled enough in her childhood that her parents sent her to boarding school in the first class only. Though a rough experience at the start still it was good. Then another major change came into his life in the form of the death of her parents. It broke her but thankfully her understanding grandmother was there for her in every step of the way. Thus, she could continue her education at the same school. During summer vacation she could visit her grandmother, otherwise, letters and landlines were there, but she preferred letters since landlines were expensive for her monthly allowance.
Shrishti's life was full of surprises, some of them she liked but the recent ones she did not like at all. First, she was sent to the boarding school, then her parents died in a bomb blast and now, she was seeing a blond guy with her grandmother.
As the Kumbh Express entered Sealdah, Naruto had only one thing on his mind how would they convince a 9-year-old child of their story he had faith in his grandma so he started playing out his part. As the train came to a halt at the platform, they waited in front of a coach. When he saw Dhriti's eyes change from anxiousness to relief, he knew she had de-boarded the train. So, he followed where her eyes were going and saw a girl of around 4'3'' waving at them or mostly at Dhriti along with another lady beside her, he knew that the girl was his would-be 'step-sister.'
As the train came to a halt, Dhriti anxiously waited for her granddaughter to de-board the train, searching all the exit points to see her face. Then she saw a teacher from the boarding school get out of the train a sense of relief came in her along with a sense of giddiness as she would see her granddaughter after a long year. She missed spending time with her. Even though, this year she would have Naruto with her to spend Durga Puja with. She still had a special corner for the daughter of her wayward son. All she wanted was a picture-perfect happy family, but sometimes you do not get everything you want. From her photo being her, her son, daughter-in-law, granddaughter, and grandson to her, her grandson and her granddaughter. But in her years, she had learnt one thing, you have to be happy with what you have. First her small family with her husband and her son, then after his death, she was all alone with her young son, who had a strong hatred towards the Indian Army due to his father's death. When he had come of his age, he left his mother to find a name for himself in Bombay. After that she was all alone until his death, still, she was alone for 11 months as for a month her granddaughter stayed with her during summer vacation but now she had Naruto with her, so she was happy with her life. Now, all that was left was for Shrishti to accept him as her 'step-brother' and for her to believe in their cooked story.
As she saw her granddaughter de-board the train a sense of relief spread in her, that she was safe. As Shrishti saw her grandmother, she immediately ran and hugged her and they started catching up at the station. (More like she rapid-fires questions, while her grandmother gives her answers to some questions in few words.) Then as the teacher approaches them, Naruto steps up to take the luggage, the teacher looks at Dhriti for confirmation and once she nods, she gives him the luggage, and they part ways as they go out of the station where a taxi was already waiting there to take them home. Once all the luggage was loaded, they straight up drove towards their home.
As they reached their house Shrishti skipped steps to enter the house while Naruto motioned to Dhriti saying that he would handle all the unloading and motioned her to go as he handled the luggage and took them inside the house. During this entire journey from Station to Home, Naruto could only get a few things out of the grandmother-granddaughter duo's conversation with his limited knowledge of Bengali. All he could get from their fluent conversation was, 'Hey grandma, miss you so' to 'I missed you too' then the greetings and when the teacher handed him the luggage, she asked 'Who is that guy', she answered 'I will tell you later' and then when they were in the taxi she again enquired about him but Dhriti skillfully evaded it by asking about how her school life, which resulted in the little girl giving animated responses.
From what Naruto could get on Shrishti, he would sketch her character as someone who is mentally strong with a bubbly mask on her face. How did he know that? Only a person who wears a mask to cover his/her real feelings can truly know about another one in a similar situation. Other than that from the conversations he could decipher that, she was average at studies, facial expression and tendencies, suggested that she was being bullied. How did he know that? When she first saw him for the first time, there was a sense of apprehension in her, normal for meeting anyone for the first time, but she was still apprehensive in the car, meaning she knew that her grandmother knew the guy and if she knew him, she told him about her being orphan. This sense of apprehension shown by her told him about her getting bullied by her peers in her state as an orphan. So all that was left was the final act that is when Dhriti tells her about him.
As they settled in her luggage while she freshened up, while the rest cooked all their lunch, the trio sat around the table and ate. One thing that Dhriti drilled into her grandchildren's minds was that no chatting while eating after that surely they could. Therefore the lunch went in relative silence. As they washed up their hands and then Dhriti asked them to meet in the living room where they sat as Dhriti began to speak.
"Shrishti I want to tell you something, but first I do not want you to jump to conclusions." Dhriti started speaking in English, but Shrishti interrupted her by saying, "{Thamma, why are we speaking in English?}" ('Thamma' ['Th' pronunciation as the same as the 'Th' of 'Thug'] is used for paternal grandmother, while Dida is used for general as well as maternal grandmother. Also {"Speaking"} means they are conversing in Bengali)
"{Because it is important, now let me continue.}" Dhriti's voice was soft yet firm sending the message across.
"Okay"
"Now as I was saying, I need you to be calm and listen. Okay?"
"Okay"
So she then started her tale, "Long ago, before your father met your mother, your father went to study abroad in Europe, specifically in the United Kingdom. I knew about it through a family friend. Shrishti, I don't know if your father told you about this or not, but my and Anurag's relationship was strained at best. During the war of 1971, your grandfather was martyred for this country. While I grieved at my loss, I still had pride knowing that he died doing something he felt pride in. But in this entire thing, I neglected my child, I neglected how he felt. I thought, that if I gave him some time, he might come to terms with his father's death, but it had the opposite effect on him, he became bitter. Bitter towards the army, bitter toward me. The relationship strained to the point that he moved out of the house. When he was in Europe he met another woman, and no, not your mother. She was a blonde euro-japanese woman, Naiomi Uzumaki. They both were enrolled in the same course, so they started interacting with each other. That interaction soon changed to attraction and before anyone knew they were ready for marriage. But then it all fell apart."
"How?" Shrishti, who was invested in this story asked.
"When Anurag went to ask her hand in marriage to her mother, she instantly declined it. The marriage fell apart and he came back to India. What he did not know was that she was pregnant with their male child. From what I know she argued with her mother and the mother and shortly after her mother died, she moved to Japan to raise her child. 10 years later she died of an incurable illness. Her child came here just months ago when he heard about Anurag's death."
"So you mean to say that?..."
"{Sigh} Shrishti you have a step-brother."
"Step-brother?"
"Brother from another mother, Shrishti."
"Ooo. So is it?"
"His name is Naruto Uzumaki and he is sitting in front of you."
As her grandmother said uttered those lines her whole world crashed down. The guy who was with them was her BROTHER! She needed time to process all the information, so she stood up and left. "Shrishti wait!"
While all the conversation was going on, the said person, Naruto was in deep thought. The original conversation was supposed to be short and precise, but Dhriti added the details and improvised it. During that improvisation, he pondered upon a question. A question which will be the question of his life. The question was, 'What is more important, Family or Duty?' As Dhriti was trying to go after Shrishti, Naruto stopped her by saying, "Let her go grandma, she needs to cope with the information. It might take some time but let her form her own opinion on this matter."
Dhriti proudly smiled at her eldest and then quipped, "You know I am the elder in the room." Naruto then bit back cleverly by saying, "I know but sometimes you act like a child." It gave him the desired reaction as she fumed then, she saw Naruto's face soften as he said, "I have been through these kinds of situations, so I know that it is best of her to form her own opinions on this matter." This caught Dhriti's attention, as she put the term, 'mental manipulations' in the list of psychological damages he had.
Later that night, dinner was a lot awkward needless to say due to the afternoon talk. Dhriti was trying to make it as normal as possible, but it would seem that her grandchildren did not share the same sentiment as her. Dinner was awkward as hell as not a single word was uttered. All of the conversations that happened were during asking for more food. This awkwardness continued for three days straight, during these days both of the grandchildren had normal conversations with their grandmother but between each other, it was done in hums, nods, and grunts.
After three days, being the true Uzumaki that Naruto was, his patient limit had been broken. He now, wanted to approach Shrishti like Dhriti approached him. Before that, he had sent a letter to the tiger clan telling them not to send Kohaku for a month since they were entertaining a guest. It was received with a positive response as they knew what he meant but did not certainly mean that Kohaku would be happy. She sent her displeasure through a video message seal, by calling him a dummy many times. However, that seal did remind him to continue his seal training after Shrishti left. But for now, he would do the basics, like brush strokes and fast writing.
His train of thought halted as he approached the door, knowing the next few minutes could decide the status of a relationship. He knocked on the door and a soft 'come in' was heard as he went in. Shrishti who was at her study table, turned to see Naruto entering and mentally freaked out, "No! Nope, this is too early to have that conversation!" Meanwhile, Naruto had his mind set on approaching this conversation the conversation cautiously knowing that one misstep could degrade the whole conversation and would ruin the whole relationship.
He awkwardly came and greeted her "Hey"
She also shyly greeted him. "Hey"
After a short awkward pause in which, one could cut the tension and awkwardness with a knife Naruto said, "Should I sit here?" pointing towards the bed.
Shrishti, for her life, wanted to say no but knowing that it would be rude, she nodded. After which he sat down.
"So… What are you doing?" He started while crying inside his mind, "Ahh! Idiot! What a great start!"
"Well, I was doing the math assignment." She replied as he nodded.
"The weather is nice today right?" She nodded as he screamed in his mind. "Weather is great today right?! What am I doing? Where is my natural charism-, Oh wait! I never had natural charisma, I have always been a socially awkward and obnoxious kid!"
"Sooo…. Which class are you in?" He asked hoping this would be a good start to the conversation.
"I am in Third Class."
"Oh and are you doing well?"
"Yes"
"Well, you could just continue with your work." She nodded and went in it while mentally sighing in relief for the end of the most awkward conversation she ever had, while Naruto was mentally berating himself for the awkward conversation. As we stood up to leave, he saw her struggling with a certain math problem. When he peeked and saw the problem, he knew it as he had the same issue with the problem. At first, math was not a subject he excelled at but after Dhriti teaching him, it was a piece of cake. (It goes to show that with the right teachers and the will to learn, one can find even the most difficult subject easily.) So, he decided to help her.
"Mind if I interrupt you?" He politely asked. She shook her head giving him the green light.
"You are doing the question wrong."
"Huh?"
"You are attempting the question wrongly."
"How?"
"Well, you don't have to necessarily use that formula here…" So it started as Naruto started explaining the question to Shrishti, from one question it became a subject, and then from one subject it became all the subjects where Naruto would supervise Shrishti and explain some concepts to her while she attempted the questions. Time flew by as he tutored/helped her. As dinner time came, Dhriti went into Shrishti's room to call her, the scenery there, moved her to tears as she saw both her grandchildren getting along and spending time with each other.
This scene reminded something from her past.
Flashback
The Ghosh house was quaking as the matriarch was rampaging inside the house. "Ok, Dhriti enough. Calm down." said the patriarch, Shankar Ghosh.
"YOU SHUT UP!" she roared, "this is your fucking fault!" Many would have been appalled hearing Dhriti, but Shankar did not. While what many thought to be an arranged marriage was a love marriage. Both of them met at the military academy of Dehradun during the late British colonial period. She was there due to her father being one of the instructors, while he was a student there. During the Army March where all of the cadets and instructors' families were present, he saw her. It was love at first sight. Out of all the young ladies who were meek and shy, she stood out being the only confident one.
Their love story happened like every cliché love story, through letters. The only people who knew about this were Dhriti's mother and his senior Sam Manekshaw. But like any other cliché love story, one of their letters went to Dhriti's father. That day in combat class he was his partner and asked him weird questions about women during sparring. The next week he got a letter from his parent telling him about a suitor, and when saw the name, it was like Christmas came early. Thus they became a wedded couple.
"Dhriti calm down, not every problem's answer is brute force. To solve a problem you need to have patience and give it time, the answer will automatically come to you." Being the gentle hand in the relationship he explained.
Flashback over
"Thank you sweetheart for showing me a way, and, thank you Naruto for helping her." Dhriti thought as she called them over for dinner. Over the next two weeks, a lot changed. Dhriti continued teaching Naruto (without the shadow clones.) He practiced kanji writing and speeding it, first with a brush, then with a pen, and finally with his finger as he had the sick idea of using his blood as a binder. Also during the same period Naruto and Shrishti familiarized with each other to the point that she started calling him baurda [ Baurda is pronounced with 'au' as in 'audit' and 'da' from 'dida' and its meaning is elder brother.]
In the middle of the third week, Naruto felt as if the mood had been somber with both the granddaughter-grandmother duo not speaking much. The house instead of its sunny nature now was in a state of gloom. Naruto being Naruto confronted Dhriti in the evening. "Ok, what is wrong with you and her?" He asked her.
"What do you mean?" She counter-questioned.
"From today morning only you two have a gloomy mood. What happened?"
"Today is their death anniversary" He did not need any further explanations and asked, "Where is she?"
"On the roof."
"Roof?"
"Yes, I have a little garden there, made it with my son and husband. She always goes there as it reminds her of her time spent with her father." With that information in mind, he left for the roof.
He climbed up the stairs towards the roof. As he reached there, he saw Shrishti sitting behind the railing with each of her legs dangling downwards in between the guard rail. Naruto approached her and sat by the rail as he also dangled his legs by the rails. "Air for thoughts" He asked her.
She smiled lightly but did not say anything. He then with a light smile asked, "You miss them don't you." This got the wanted reaction as she was visibly sulking now. Naruto could only look at her in camaraderie, knowing what it was like to be an orphan. He knows what it is to always think about what would their parents be like or if would they be proud of their children.
"You know you can talk, I am here to listen." He offered her which she took.
"It hurts." She said in a whisper, when he saw her face, he saw all the raw emotions in her making it obvious this was the first time she was opening up about this topic.
"I know how it feels, the feeling that you have lost everything and now you don't what to do." She absentmindedly nodded at that, while he continued, "I also felt the same way when mum and dad died."
"So then what can I do?" She asked
"Move on."
"Move on?"
"Yes, as cruel as it sounds, you have to move on, accept the reality as cruel as it is, accept it. Accept that they are dead. As harsh as it may sound this is the best you can do. Instead of mourning them, you work and do your best in the field you chose, make them proud." He could she was sobbing a bit, and then he asked the main question, "You have been bullied about your orphan status haven't you?"
She looked at him in shock as if someone had ratted out her deepest darkest secret, "How did you know?" She asked in a low voice
"I speak from experience. I know how relentlessly people bully you just because you don't have parents." He venomously spoke as he remembered his childhood.
"How do you deal with them then?" She asked.
"You know if you had asked me this a year ago, I would have said to endure it as you are better than others, but sometimes it is important to reply to others." He started, "Next when she says something, just to her that 'at least I don't bully others to feel better' she would push you then you punch her with full power, the teachers will know and then you tell them the whole truth."
"Will that work?"
"Hundred percent. Now let it out" He held his arms out towards her as she brawled into him and broke her dam.
He held and caressed Shrishti's hair while she cried on him that evening. The next day was a fresh day for everyone, as she now became extremely close to him they spent the next weeks with each other and their grandmother like a happy family.
The passed as the day she would be leaving for her school, tears were in the eyes of the younger sibling as she refused to separate from the older one, but the older one separated from her and put his hand on her heart as she nodded and left for the train. The train after five minutes started leaving the station. The grandson-grandmother duo waved at the granddaughter from the platform as the train left.
"Interesting people you live with brat." A very familiar voice in his mind spoke to him.

Some Conversations Are Comforting And Awkward
________________________________________
Dear Big Brother,
How are you? How is Grandma? Are you all well? I am writing this to tell you that your trick TOTALLY WORKED. That bitch got what she deserved. Although I got into a bit of trouble, it was worth it! She is now expelled from the school and I also got to make a new friend. Her name is Mina Dhobal. We are in the same class. Turns out, she was also getting bullied by her. When I came back to the hostel and she started bullying me, I punched her straight in the face, being the teacher's pet that she is. She ran to our hostel head teacher, and that old bag believed her. SO UNSURPRISING! But then I told them the truth, at first they did not believe me but after many other students started to tell their stories. She was suspended. She then tried to hurt me, but I again punched her. This time she was expelled for good. However I cannot come for Durga Puja this year due to the incident and also a letter from school has been posted about the incident, so I don't know how Grandma will react to it. Anyway, I will be waiting for your reply.
Love
Shrishti (Your Little Sister)
________________________________________
Dear Shrishti,
ATTA GIRL! I received your letter and am extremely proud of what you did. But do not make it an excuse to start bullying others okay? And do not worry about the letter from school I have handled it. Grandma and I are doing very well. She and I will miss you for the puja but you need to learn that every action has consequences. Anyway, do well this year and next year also Happy Birthday in advance. Knowing that it is during the puja, I might forget about it so yes. I will wait for a reply.
Your Loving Elder Brother,
Naruto

Sealdah Railway Station
[Let me make this clear once and for all. From now on I won't parenthesize any more dialogue. Frankly, it was hard doing it in previous chapters. From now on, assume that Naruto conversing with Dhriti is in English. Japanese is for all the summoning creatures, bijuus, and Bengali for when he is conversing with people other than those mentioned previously.]
The duo of grandson-grandmother was waving as their sister or granddaughter respectively, left on the train.
"Interesting people you live with brat." A very familiar voice in Naruto's mind spoke. He momentarily had his eyes wide open, knowing very well whose voice belonged to but, did not have the time to reply as someone tapped his shoulder twice. When he saw the person, Kyuubi in his mind, had a wary look because of the vibes the person was giving as if it was of destruction itself.
He turned to see the person. There he saw a couple standing beside him. The male was a good foot taller than him. Also, he had raven hair with a bluish tint along with green eyes while the female was one of the most beautiful women he had seen in his short life. She was around two inches shorter than the male, had silky-smooth raven hair along with beautiful raven eyes that were an abyss for anyone who stared at them.
"Yes," He replied.
"Hello, my name is Shivansh Das and this is my wife, Parvati, we were wondering if you could help us by telling us where this location is?" The now-named Shivansh asked Naruto while pointing at the paper, in which the address was written.
Once he glanced at the paper, he recognized the address. "Oh, Hi I am Naruto. This house, yes, I know where it is. It is just the next house to ours, let us drop you there." Naruto requested. That is when Dhriti joined in the conversation. "Hello, I am Dhriti, his grandmother."
"Oh hello ma'am, I am Shivansh and this is Parvati." They touched Dhriti's feet as she gave the blessings [A cultural thing in India to touch the feet of Elders to receive their blessings]. "We were just asking him about this address."
"Oh, are you shifting there?" Dhriti asked.
"Yes"
"Then you will be our new neighbors. Let us escort you there."
"You don't have to do such things."
"I insist." Shiva caved in and nodded while they boarded the train to Howrah Station from there to Digha as they de-boarded from the local train, Naruto went in search of a taxi. While traveling, they learned a lot about the couple. They were married at the age of 17 and were newlyweds. They shifted from Krishnanagar to Digha. Their goods were already transported, thus they only carried two suitcases. This piece of information checked up with all the hustling that was going on in their adjacent house. Once they started conversing, Naruto and Shivansh hit it off on their second or third conversation. From the said conversation, they learned a lot about each other, like Naruto being from America while having a Japanese name. At the same time, Naruto found out that Shivansh was a knowledgeable and intellectual person. He also has a welcoming vibe and a subtle dangerous vibe that only very few people could catch on to. But otherwise, he was a nice guy. In those four hours of journey, they familiarized themselves with each other to the point that the couple started calling Dhriti aunty while Naruto made them his pseudo-elder siblings. This sparked banter between the couple and Dhriti as the elder woman insisted the couple come to dinner and lunch at their house. Still, the couple denied that request by saying that they did not want to impose on the duo but a little pressing and they caved in by saying that tomorrow they would have lunch and dinner at their home, which they agreed to and a plan was made.
Their taxi arrived and they got in with the destination predetermined and the fare prepaid which the rest three learned once they got out of the taxi. Shivansh was a bit peeved when he learned that Naruto already paid the fare, but Naruto brushed it off by saying that it was fine. That afternoon, once the couple settled in, Naruto called them for lunch at their house. The menu was rice, flatbread, Aaloo Posto [A curry of Potato and Poppy seeds] along with Dal Shukto [ curry which acts like a palate cleanser] and some Misti Doi [ sweet yogurt]. This was taken into consideration as the couple was vegetarian. Once the lunch started the flavor profile of the dishes blew away both the couple and Naruto's minds. After the hearty meal, the couple left more than satisfied and Naruto grilled Dhriti for the dishes, something that was repeated during the dinner after a day of showing the couple the locality. After the dinner Both Parvati and Naruto were interested in the recipes so Dhriti happily gave them the recipe and gave the couple her blessing for a long and happy married life which left the said couple a bit embarrassed.
"You had to do that?" He asked with a raised eyebrow once the guests left.
"What? They are a cute couple so blessings are normal to give them."
"That or you wanted to fluster them."
"Maybe or Maybe not. Tehee" She bonked her head.
"Thank god no one sees you like this except for me, or all that reputation down the drain." He thought while being irritated by this old hag with the mentality of a child.
"What are you thinking?" She asked.
"I am thinking, since all the events and recovering is done, I want to get back in shape."
"How would you do that?"
"I think I would take the help of the tigers in this case while still learning from you and going to the library."
"Ok."
Without further he summoned Kohaku and was a bit shocked to see her. When he first met her, she was the size of a kitten and while staying with Dhriti he saw her grow to the size of an adult cat. Now when he summons her after a good month she is the size of a Siberian husky. Dhriti was also shocked at the growth while Naruto was gawking.
"What are you staring at?" Kohaku asked sassily.
"Well, size is not the only thing that has changed." He thought.
"Kohaku-chan is that you?" Asked a shocked Dhriti.
She immediately shrunk into a kitten and jumped towards Dhriti, "Dhriti" she cried and settled into her arms while the said woman was petting her and the said cat was loudly purring.
Having had enough of his summons's attitude, he asked her, "Hey, Kohaku can you do me a favor."
"What favor?" She asked with an attitude while purring. "So the sassiness is only objective." He thought while asking, "Could you ask your mom to come here in a shrunk size so that I could talk to her?"
She looked at Dhriti as if asking her permission, which triggered Naruto, "You are my summon not hers!" He mentally shouted while looking at the duo. After a few seconds, she disappeared in a smoke and after a few minutes, two kitten-sized white tigers appeared in front of Naruto.
"What do you want brat?" Shirotora demanded. "Great no respect from my summons at all, just fucking great." Naruto thought while lamenting the lack of respect from the said clan. Then his face had a serious demeanor on it making Shirotora straighten up, "I want to resume my shinobi training." She only nodded. This caught Dhriti's interest. Being from a military background, she was always interested in knowing about the military of different nations, according to Naruto, shinobi was a type of military, so she became interested and asked, "I don't want to interrupt, but I would like to know what the shinobi training entails?" She asked politely.
Shirotora sighed before explaining, "Shinobi training entails a lot of things like physical conditioning so that the idiot [Naruto] could be agile and flexible. Then there is kunai and shuriken throwing, taijutsu, ninjutsu, genjutsu, and additional things like bujkijutsu and then there is senjutsu so, there are many things he can learn." Dhriti nodded. "If I could make any suggestion, I would like to teach him also." On this request, Naruto, and Shirotora thought about it and came to a unanimous agreement in favor of the request.
"So, what could you teach him?" Queried Shirotora
"Well, since I am from a military background, I have contacts in the army, who could teach him taijutsu, other than that I could teach him some tactics, what do you say?"
"Okay let's do that." Shirotora agreed.
"We can do it, I train taijutsu with him and then you guys train me," Naruto suggested.
"There will be a problem." Dhriti interrupted, and when she had the attention of the rest of them she continued, "For taijutsu, we have to send him out of here so he loses contact with me and also he cannot do any shinobi jutsus, that will create its problem."
Shirotora nodded and then went into deep thinking, questioning whether she should tell them about something or not, but after a short internal debate, she saw the benefit in telling that jutsu to them.
"I know a jutsu that can counter this problem." She spoke up gaining the attention of the residents and then she continued, "The jutsu is called 'Ketsueki kurōn no jutsu' "
"Blood clone? How is it different from the shadow clone?" Naruto asked.
"It is a forbidden technique, which like shadow clone does give memory feedback but also physical feedback, which can result in the death of the user. The physical feedback works in the way, say you create the clone and it becomes obese, then once dispelled you will also become obese, but since the original will not be ready for the sudden obesity, it will rip the digestive system apart." She explained grimly.
"So you are saying that if he does the Jutsu, we need to ensure that both the clone and original should be in the same physical condition?" Kohaku asked her mother to which she nodded, affirming the solution.
After thinking for a bit Naruto spoke up, "I have an idea." Getting the room's attention on him he continued, "We can send Kohaku to my clone to ask for the dietary and physical routine and repeat it here and vice-versa, what do you think?"
"Risky, but doable." Dhriti commented while Kohaku nodded, "I am ok with it."
Seeing that the three parties involved were ok with the given task she nodded, "So how much time does it take to make a clone?" Dhriti asked intrigued by the jutsu since she had seen what shadow clones can do, she was curious about the said jutsu.
"About 5 minutes," Shirotora replied.
"Hmm. Then I can call him today and he will be there by midday tomorrow." She said.
"Who is this guy you are calling?" Naruto asked.
"He is my brother's younger grandson, Manjot Singh Tabbar. He has the rank of Major in the army and is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter. I will call him right now, along with my brother so, that if he wants to take you to Punjab, they will be ready." She said. While Kohaku asked, "Where is this Punjab?"
"It is in another part of India," Naruto replied. While she nodded and Dhriti looked proudly at her grandson for not forgetting the geography of India which included the 25 states and the 7 union territories [For all those shumcks, who are going to fact-check me in the review section, let me humbly remind you that the story is based in the 1990s not 2020s.] After that both the white tigers nodded and left while Naruto wished goodnight to Dhriti and left towards his room, leaving her to call the people, which she started doing by first calling the eastern command to ask for Manjot Singh Tabbar.
"This is Eastern command, how may I help you?"
"Could you please contact Major Manjot Singh Tabbar, say Dhriti Agarwal Ghosh wanted to speak to him." The receiver immediately knew what to do, since everyone in the Eastern Command knew who Brig. Shankar Ghosh was, and who his wife was, Dhriti could hear the chap telling Manjot that Army Lady wanted to him. Manjot knowing it was his dearest grandmother picked up the phone excitedly.
"Pairi Pauna Dadi." [Literal meaning 'touching your feet grandmother' but it is a greeting towards the elders in the Sikh and Punjabi community, a way of asking for their blessings. 'D' in 'Dadi' is like the 'D' in 'Dida'] Manjot greeted.
"Jeeta Rahe." [Literal meaning 'keep winning/ live longer', it is used as a blessing towards the younger to bless them with long life and good fortune] She greeted back.
[THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION WILL BE IN PUNJABI AND I AM TIRED OF WRITING IT SO HAVE THE ENGLISH VERSION OF SAID CONVERSATION.]
"Why did you call me grandma?"
"When are you going back to Punjab?"
"In a week, since the [Operation] Blue Star and [Operation] Black Thunder and the assassination of Indira-Ji, this distrust is at an all-time high, hence in a week, I am getting transferred to the Sikh Regiment. Why?"
"I need you to come to my house."
"Sure, is there any problem?"
"No, but there is a person I want you to meet."
"Who?"
Dhriti took a deep breath before dropping the bombshell, "Naruto Uzumaki, my grandson."
Manjot had to double-take before asking, "I am sorry WHO?!"
Dhriti sighed before explaining everything to Manjot. After which he replied, "Wow, ok I did not know about that, so like a family visit?"
"No, I want you to teach him army level Hand-to-hand combat and other stuff. He had shown interest in the army."
"You know that takes about 6 to 7 months."
"That is why I want you to take him to Punjab, train him, and send him back."
"Does he know Punjabi?"
"No, but he is fluent in Japanese, and English and is broken in Bengali but understands Hindi yet cannot speak it."
"OK, then I will be there by tomorrow afternoon."
"Fine, but call me once you reach the station."
"Ok, will do. Goodbye Dadi"
"Goodbye."
Now all she had to do was wait for about 5 to 10 minutes before her brother called her. As she predicted after seven minutes her telephone rang and the caller was none other than her younger brother Balbir Singh Tabbar.
"Hello," She greeted.
"Dhriti, what the hell am I hearing? Anurag had another child, an elder that we have not been told about?"
"Yes, you heard it correctly Balbir." And then she again re-iterated the sob story they conjured up.
"Why wasn't I informed?!" He shouted
"And what the hell would you have done if informed?!" She shouted back signaling her brother who was the elder one.
"I would have taken him in. The kid is still our family member!"
"I got the news about the pregnancy ten years ago and three months ago I could track him, how the hell do you think I could tell you?!"
"Fine, so when is he coming here?"
"I am sending him with Manjot for half a year to yours. He had shown great potential and thinking skills like father's."
"That is the only reason?"
"No you dumbass, he wants to learn more about the army. Anyways how is everything going on there?"
"We are managing, but the unrest is still there. People are recovering from the Bhirndranwale and Police situation, otherwise, things are great. He will be safe here."
"Balbir, I am trusting his life with you."
"I will keep him safe."
"Thank you. Bye"
"Bye Sister."
She took a sigh of relief knowing that all things went smoothly with the decision and living arrangements, now everything was up to Naruto or rather his blood clone.
Meanwhile in his room, after a long day, Naruto's head hit the pillow. He entered his mindscape to meet a familiar nine-tailed beast behind the iron bars.
"Well, well, well, it has been a long time since we met brat not that I want to see that ugly face of yours, but your bastard of a father put us in this condition." The said nine-tailed beast said hoping for a rise.
"Well, it has been three months." He replied evenly.
"Quite the interesting people you've met here," Kyuubi said while internally surprised as his container did not take the bait and kept his cool, so he prodded him again.
"Well, you could say that they are certainly interesting," Naruto said again without giving away much emotion. This surprised Kyuubi so, it took another dig at him.
"Will they be trustworthy after you tell them about your dirty little secret?" He was a little rattled, from what the Kyuubi could sense from his emotion but then quickly composed himself.
"Well, that is for the time to tell Furball." After that quip, Naruto quickly left his mindscape while the said 'furball' raged inside his mind. But that conversation remained in his mind, 'What would they think?' this question plagued his mind while he was resting and preparing himself for tomorrow.
Morning rolled up after an excruciating amount of time for Naruto as he first thing freshened up, had a light breakfast, and went towards the roof, after a light workout, he came down to the living hall to find Parvati already there, "Di?" [Elder Sister?]
"Oh, Naruto you are here!" Dhriti exclaimed and then continued, "Parvati here was asking us to come to their house for breakfast."
"Oh, ok sure, so when do we leave?"
"Now."
"Now?"
"Yes now get your ass moving!"
"Right, Grandma!"
Parvati chuckled at the family dynamics, as the three of them left towards the Das house. The house in itself was large but cozy, giving them their home vibes. There they met Shivansh who as there in the living room waiting for them. After exchanging greetings Shivansh guided them towards their dining hall. Out of all these things, Dhriti noticed quite a few things, like they were rich but had a down-to-earth personality. Also seeing the interaction between the couple reminded her of her marriage that is, outside the house both of them had a lot of respect but inside the house, the pants of the relationship was Parvati.
On the dining table, they were served the Bengali classic Luchi and Aloo Curry [Luchi is a type of fried bread and Aloo means Potato] just one bite of it sent her to heaven as her eyes widened in surprise. This was the same reaction as Naruto's as he was also mesmerized by the taste. The food was so comforting, for him for a moment it felt like his mother was there for him during his hardships, almost bringing tears to his eyes.
"Parvati, it is very delicious." Dhriti complimented her cooking.
"Auntie, it cannot be that delicious." Said Parvati, downplaying the compliment.
"No di it was very delicious," Naruto spoke up.
"Yes young lady, you should be more proud of your skills," Dhriti said and then turning towards Shivansh she spoke, "Young Man she is a keeper, take good care of her so, if there any kind of arguments, I will be on your ass young man." Which made everyone smile, while, the rest of the breakfast went by knowing the couple well. It turned out that Shivansh's family was in the demolition business and Parvati's side of the family was in the catering business. Dhriti once joked that they were like the divine couple Lord Shiva and Lady Parvati, which interested Naruto but he filed it for later.
After spending a good amount of time Naruto and Dhriti said goodbyes to their neighbor and went to their house once inside Dhriti motioned Naruto to go into the living room. Once there, both of them settled down for a chat in which Dhriti gave a brief but important part of Punjab's political and cultural scenario when she told him that he would move to Punjab for his training. For him, the situation in Punjab was simply a cluster fuck of a situation. The head of the country is assassinated by one of your kinsmen and then the rest of the community comes under fire. After which a crazy leader rises in your community who wanted a separate state and then the siege of one of your holy places, that's fucked up.
However, this situation resonated with him with the Uchiha incident, in both cases it was one of their kinsmen, here it was one of the bodyguards, and there it was that wannabe Madara Uchiha, then both of them were under scrutiny, as he heard from those old bats that 'Uchihas betrayed the village' which was more logical as for their massacre than a 12-year-old crumbling under pressure and going berzerk.
He was brought out of this thought process when he heard the telephone ringing. He saw Dhriti picking up the telephone and nodding and then telling him to come here safely who he thought was his 'cousin' Manjot, one of his nine cousins. "Naruto" Dhriti called him.
"Yes Grandma"
"Summon them"
"Ok"
With that, he went through the hand seals required for summoning jutsu to summon the mother-daughter duo to their house. Once they were summoned Shirotora spoke up, "Is it time?"
Naruto nodded and then said, "So what do we need for the ritual."
"Your blood and hair. By the way how good is your kanji?"
"I can copy any given kanji down to a stoke in a small amount of time."
"How much time do you need to copy this on a larger scale" She then showed a matrix that was a 16-pronged matrix and had the kanji of blood written in between. [Imagine the chakra-suppressing seal but the kanji for blood is written in the center.]
"About 2 minutes."
"Good. Now give me a bundle of your hair and about this much blood." She gave him a narrow glass. Then he proceeded to give her the necessary items.
Then with the help of Dhriti in a pot, they put some ink Shirotora had brought and then heated it mixed his blood and hair into it and then slapped a seal on it, and then made Naruto do the hand seals 'Tiger-Horse-Boar-Monkey-Ram-Serpent-Tiger-Horse' after which the previously black solution turned red. Which, for Dhriti was something akin to black magic.
Then Shirotora motioned Naruto to pick up the solution after it cooled down and instructed him to make the matrix in a secluded place in the house he did that after which she let the matrix dry and then instructed Naruto to stand in between the matrix and make the hand signs which she wrote on a piece of paper.
Naruto followed her instructions and did the hand signs, 'Bird-Ram-Rat-Bird-Monkey-Ox-Rat-Ram-Dragon-Boar-Hare-Monkey-Rat-Serpent-Tiger-Ram-Horse-Ox-Bird-Dragon-Bird-Monkey-Rat-Ram-Boar-Serpent-Ram-Ox-Serpent-Tger-Dog-Tiger-Rat-Bird-Horse-Ox-Bird-Boar-Rat-Hare-Monkey-Ox' and said 'Blood Clone Jutsu'. The effects were instantaneous as Naruto felt as if half of his soul and energy suddenly left him and collapsed on the ground while the matrix formed a double helix shape and then took the shape of a human slowly morphing into Naruto while the real one was in his senses but was collapsed on the ground.
Then the clone collapsed on the ground while Naruto slowly got up with the help of Dhriti, "Ok what the hell was that?!"
"How do you feel?" Shirotora asked in anticipation.
"I feel like half of my soul left me, what in the actual FUCK was that?!" Naruto exclaimed.
"That means the jutsu is working, now we have to wait for 2 to 3 minutes for the clone to wake up," Shirotora replied and Naruto nodded. As guessed the clone woke up after 3 minutes, a bit disgruntled but after some time he was fine, then they hatched a plan, till the time Manjot was there the clone would be the one here with Kohaku acting like the house cat which was bought 2 months ago, much to the displeasure of the said house cat and Naruto, the original one, would be in Taigahiru for that duration of time.
With all the related parties' consent, both the original Naruto and Shirotora reverse summoned themselves to Mount Taigahiru, while the clone Naruto, who had the memories of the real Naruto went into his room to finish his packing for six months in Punjab and Dhriti who was a bit weirded out from this situation, prepared herself to meet her Grandnephew after a long time. So everyone was prepared for the upcoming endeavor, who was only 5 minutes away from their house.
In Mount Taigahiru
Naruto and Shirotora, after a successful planning reached there, once on the mountain Shirotora regrew into her original size, reminding Naruto that she was not a cute house cat. Once there Naruto turned towards Shirotora and called her, "Hey Shirotora I wanted to ask you something."
"What is it brat?" She counter-questioned.
"Boss of toads or Boss of tigers, I am not getting any respect, am I?" He internally sighed but spoke up, "As we discussed, I wanted to restart my training and I want to strategize it right now."
Shirotora smirked as she liked those eager to train and break their bones and she could see that her summoner was one of them. "Well I have the right tiger for you, but a warning, if you start the training there is no turning back and also you might die." She warned him but in return, he gave her an arrogant smirk and said, "I know what I am signing for and have had few meet up with death so yeah, I am born ready."
She knew she liked her summoner but now she knew why she liked him and he proved it to her. She then led him to a cave, while Naruto had a sense of foreboding and then she called someone called 'Pa'. Suddenly an old and short tiger came into view, "Oh Shiro-chan what brought you to this old tige-." Suddenly, he leaped up and Naruto's vision slowly went black, "NOT AGAIN!" He mentally screamed before he lost consciousness.
"PA that was our new summoner! Ma already took her test!" She yelled at the old tiger.
"Oh, my bad haha haha haha…." The old tiger tried to downplay his embarrassment at not knowing about their new summoner. Shirotora just shook her head at the senile Tiger.
After some time he woke up to see the old tiger looking at him. "Oh, you are awake, sorry for the hit earlier. Anyways nice to meet you Naruto Uzumaki, I am Jiitora but you can call me Pa."
"Well nice to meet you too pa, I think Shirotora told you about why I am here," Naruto said
"Well, she did that you are a jinchuuriki and that you want shinobi training."
"Well yes, I want to be a lethal shinobi without the Kyuubi's chakra."
"Hmm... well could you tell me that without Kyuubi's chakra, how good of a shinobi are you?"
Swallowing his pride, knowing that he might not get a better teacher than the tigers he said, "Absolute shit, I do not have any type of taijutsu form, I can neither dispel nor cast a proper genjutsu, in terms of ninjutsu, I only know, transform, substitute, shadow clone and Rasengan other than that I only recently started fuinjutsu and my accuracy is 70%."
"Good, the first step of solving a problem is to know there is a problem. Do not worry I or anyone would not judge you." Jiitora said kindly as he nodded then he left the room and called, "Tsuyo-chan! Sokudo-kun!"
Then after some time, two tigers came near them and Jiitora spoke up, "Naruto they are Tsuyotora and Sokudotora" pointing at the tigress with ash-colored fur and the tiger with big three scars running through his left eye respectively. "And you two this is our new summoner Naruto Uzumaki." Then he started explaining the situation to them. After understanding the situation Tsuyotora asked him, "Naruto-san could you tell me how good is your chakra control?"
"Well, I can do vertical walking [Another Name for tree walking, personally I think that 'Tree Walking' as an exercise name is a bit weird as tree walking could be done on walls too] and running along with walking on water?"
"How long can you do it, Vertical walking?"
"I honestly don't know but I can do it for long amounts of time."
"Okay and do ripples generally appear in the water you walk upon?"
"Yes, they do."
"How big are they?"
"Like that stone width-wise." Naruto pointed toward a small stone that looked like a small plate
"Hmm…" She thought for a moment then said to Jiitora, "Pa, from what I have understood Naruto-san has a lot of chakra, but the control is that of an average chakra user." Jiitora nodded, while she continued.
"Naruto-san, Pa said you had a jutsu that could help you learn things quickly."
"Yeah, it's called the shadow clone jutsu."
"Could you explain that jutsu to me please?"
"Yeah, the Jutsu allows me to create one or more copies of myself. My chakra is evenly divided between myself and my clones. So when popped I get my chakra back, while also getting my memories back."
"And what is your limit for the clones?"
"Well if I want it as cannon fodder, the max I can do is 2 thousand, and when I require the memories it simmers down to twenty."
"Okay." She said. Then Sokudotora jumped on questions and asked his own and after some time it was decided that the white tigers would help him with learning the six stages of chakra control which would take six months. These stages included, Leaf sticking, rock sticking, vertical walking, water walking, waterfall walking and sand separating. Within this time frame Sokudo promised to whip him up in shape and during this discussion, he met Tsetsutora who said he would help him learn taijutsu, and Inkantora who would help him with fuinjutsu. As the timetable was set all that now he had to do was wait for Kohaku to appear.
He did not have to wait for long as Kohaku appeared and with the help of Jiitora, he was sent back to his house.
The Ghosh House
After Naruto left, Manjot entered the house 5 minutes later. After the meet and greet, Manjot met Naruto or The Blood Clone Naruto. Both of them sat down and started chatting. Being in the army, if one holds a higher rank, it is a requirement to know English, so conversing in English with his cousin was easy for him, though he was impressed with his knowledge of certain subjects. After some minutes they hit it off. They conversed on many things, like his motivation for Army which he made an excuse that even Dhriti bought it. Then on the topic of age and Academics, Naruto lied by saying he studied till the tenth and then dropped out after his mother's death and is currently seventeen which led to some jabs on his height. After some light snacks, Naruto went and called a taxi to Sealdah.
After saying their goodbyes, both left for Sealdah where they will catch Akal Takt Express to Amritsar and then a bus to Kartarpur. As the duo left, Kohaku reverse-summoned and then the original Naruto appeared.
"So, everything went well, grandma?" He asked
"Yeah, it was good, how about on your side?"
"Yeah, it was good. So what did my clone say?"
She then started to reiterate the conversation and Naruto wanted to kill his clone very badly, first for the age and then the education. Then he asked himself, "How am I going to send my knowledge to him?"
"Well, that would not be a problem." A voice that did not belong to Dhriti spoke. Both Naruto and Dhriti jumped at the voice and when they looked down they saw a tiger, "Pa do not scare me like that and how did you even get here?!" Naruto exclaimed and then questioned.
"Did you forget I also reverse-summoned with you? Honestly you little cubs these days." Jiitora replied while shaking his head.
"Pa?" Dhriti, who was equally surprised by the situation, then spoke up.
"Oh, you must be Dhriti. Ko-chan had spoken a lot about you." Jiitora said.
"Ko-chan?"
"Kohaku." Naruto supplied from the side.
"And you are?" She question Jiitora.
"Oh where are my manners, I am Jiitora, one of the elder tigers." He said and then explained how he met Naruto and their conversation on Mount Taigahiru, "… So, as I was telling the intel sharing would not be a problem as both the clone and Naruto share the same chakra so, if you pop a shadow clone both of you will receive the memories."
"So information sharing will not be a problem," Naruto said and Jiitora nodded. After some more shot conversations, Jiitora reverse summoned himself, while Naruto and Dhriti were called by Parvati for lunch. At lunch the menu ranged from rice, battered fried brinjal (aubergine/eggplant), and potato along with spinach and paneer curry (cottage cheese curry). Again the praises from breakfast continued in lunch as both of them were mesmerized by the food. After saying their goodbyes the grandmother-grandson duo left the house to go to their own house. Once both of them left, Parvati let out a sigh, turned towards her husband, and said,
"Shiva, this is not going to age well."
"What is not going to age well dear?"
"These theatrics that we are doing here."
"What theatrics?"
"Shiva for us sake, do not act like a child right now!"
"But I am not."
"Shiva, right now do not act like a teenager and act like the god of destruction that you are."
"Ok, but I know what I am doing Parvati"
"Oh really, because I think both of us are here because you got a silly prophecy."
"Parvati!"
"Do not Parvati me. You are the god of destruction, not the god of prophecy."
"But it was important."
"The same excuse you gave me a week ago."
Flashback A week ago in Devanagari,
Shiva, the god of destruction rarely sweated but the dream he got last night had him woke with sweat covering his forehead, he woke up his wife Parvati, the goddess of marriage,
"Dear, what happened?" His wife said in a groggy voice.
"Nothing dear, just go to sleep. I thought about something." He replied as both of them went to sleep.
The next day, Parvati was suspicious of her husband as he was a bit on his toes and the first thing he did was visit Vishwakarma and their daughter Saraswati together. And for the rest of the week, he was still acting like he was hiding something, if he was then he was doing a worse job. Finally losing her patience she confronted him. And one thing that every husband knows is that 'hell hath no fury a wife scorned'. So like a good husband, he spilled out the whole prophecy and then convinced her of his plan to go to West Bengal as a recently married couple. So they went and by chance met their target of surveillance at the railway station only.
Flashback Over.
"I just hope you know what are doing," Parvati said.
"Me too, dear, me too" Shiva replied.
That night Naruto was sleeping in bed while thinking about the next six months as he knew that those upcoming months would make or break him. Also that question about, telling about the fox to Dhriti still plagued his mind from yesterday, but he kept delaying it intentionally, hoping for some more time before he told her, telling himself that he was not ready to tell her about the fox yet.
As Naruto predicted the upcoming months were gruesome for him, the first month for Naruto was tiring as hell. He even barely had the energy to talk, for the first week, both for his clone and him, their body ached. While it was tiring for him he still persevered. He was mesmerized by the scenario of Punjab, but he was motivated more by the people, their open-mindedness, and their perseverance. Also, he saw the general mistrust while going towards Punjab. He met Abhijit Ghoshal, the person who saved him, he was eternally grateful to him. During this time he also developed a competitive spirit, thanks to Dhriti and Shiva. Once he got demolished in chess by Shiva, he started learning chess tactics. Meanwhile, in Punjab, his clone got into the army regime well. As for his shinobi training by now he could say that he could stick leaves and rocks on him and could be as still as he wanted to be while his vertical walking had made progress to the point he could stick his back to the ceiling without wasting unnecessary chakra and his water waking was also fixed by Tsuyotora and Inkantora helped him breeze through the first three levels of sealing with ease and made him a master of those three levels to the point that he could do it with his eyes closed.
As the month came to an end, he was feeling pretty motivated as not only was he whipped up to shape by Sokudotora but also now he could retain the memories of 40 shadow clones. With that, he made progress in his studies as he finally caught up to his 8th standard syllabus but also spoke fluent Bengali and broken Hindi along with a bit of Punjabi. The kids in his locality started calling him 'engraji dada' [literal translation is 'English older brother' used as a term of endearment to a person who speaks fluent English in West Bengal during the 90s era]. So coming into the second month he had a more positive outlook toward the future.
The second month saw him doing an army hand-to-hand combat regime which was tough but he still fought through it. Along with that, he grew closer to the Tabbar family to the point that the rest of the eight cousins started calling him elder brother. While for the original him, he finally started taijutsu practice along with weapons practice with Tsetsutora and it was absolute torture along with the waterfall walking, which for him was an impossible task, along with that he now started learning grade ninth and tenth syllabus to be ready for future. Some subjects were horrendous but some interested him, like, history, physics, mathematics, and chemistry. During this month he studied a lot of military tactics to use in chess as Shiva defeated him while he used chess tactics. As he started the fourth level of fuinjutsu, it started fucking his mind as the problems were a bit more complex now.
With the second month coming to an end he received the letter from Shrishti which said what she did to the bully, and Naruto covered for her by making stuff up as to why she could not attend that year's Durga Puja and wrote an apology letter for Shrishti's action to the school which gave him practice in writing and forgery, another aspect of being a shinobi. He also did well in the military academy that year as his hand-to-hand combat training was getting better. People were starting to call him a prodigy, not knowing about the blood and sweat he poured behind the scenes. While with the original, that month he was halfway through level four of the sealing along with familiarizing himself with katana and the tiger-style taijutsu form. Now he could climb up to half of the waterfall with his accuracy increased by 90%. In academics now he could say that he was a tenth-pass student.
With the third month, he was put into his mind game as the syllabus of the three streams was a bit much for him but he was going to persevere through it, Dhriti now permitted him to shop for groceries and other things, giving him a sense of independence. During this month for the first time, he was able to defeat Shiva in chess, but he did not want a narrow-margin victory but wanted to decimate him so he was still working hard. Also during this time something that Parvati said caused unrest in him as she said that a real family accepts their member without any prejudices. This sparked up the debate about whether should he tell her about his past or not, but he again left it for later.
By the end of the third month, his hand-to-hand combat training was almost over. Also, he cleared the fourth level of sealing along with climbing the waterfall. As now his accuracy was at one hundred percent, they also discovered that he had sensing abilities that gassed him up. He also became a bit proficient with tiger style and kenjutsu. The biggest development was that now he could make 500 shadow clones whose memories he could remember but overusing it gave him a headache so he challenged himself to not faint.
The fourth month moved him to tears, as not only had Dhriti remembered his birthday, but even threw a surprise party, and the gifts he received moved him to tears, none of them were expensive gifts, but the thought behind them moved him to tears. This time again the thought to tell her about his past came into his head, after seeing what she had done for him, but the inner fear blocked him from sharing things. During this time in Punjab, his bond with the family deepened to the point, that Balbir became a father figure to him. During that time both the original and the clone dyed their hair black and started to grow their hair.
As the month ended, Naruto struggled in separating the sand exercise, while he was a bit proficient in kenjutsu and tiger style now, he had completed his eleventh standard syllabus for all streams [Science, Commerce, and Humanities] with the help of his shadow clones and had completed level 4 of sealing. While in Punjab he was now a master of the hand to hand combat to the army and moved on to ammunitions.
In the fifth month he with the help of Abhijit, who was at that point like a brother in all but blood, and Shiva and Parvati threw a party for Dhriti. The old woman was moved to tears to see her grandson's considerate nature. Along with that, she received presents from her neighbors and Abhijit and a lot of others, knowing what she had done for the community, also by then he was familiar with the locality to the point he knew everyone's name and they knew his name but had given him a nickname 'Vidyut' [meaning 'thunder'] after he explained the meaning of his name.
By the end of that month, he was a level 5 master at sealing due to it being similar to level for and he had almost completed the separating of sands exercise while he was good at kenjutsu to the point he could defeat an average Jounin also now he started mixing army style with tiger style to make a well-balanced style. Academically he was halfway through 12th standard and was gaining additional knowledge by debating with Shiva and Abhijit. While in Punjab his training with guns was going well as he could now disassemble and assemble a lot of guns and know how to use them (thanks to his shadow clones) and chose to do sniper training.
As the last month arrived he knew his basic shinobi training was almost complete as the level six of fuinjutsu was very similar to the previous two and now that he was on the verge of completing his chakra control training which made his control near perfect to the point he tried to recreate Tsunade's super strength and trying to assimilate it with his fighting style. So when the month came to an end, he had completed and mastered all the chakra control exercises, as a result, he could now easily manipulate the number of clones he required up to two thousand and see each memory, and was proficient in kenjutsu and taijutsu along with being a level six fuinjutsu master, the result being he could understand a little about how his seal was crafted. As a sort of graduation exam, he first had to face Kohaku. Sure the tigress did not go easy on him but he bested her in the fight and then his next opponent was her mother, he knew he could not win this fight, but his life taught him a big lesson to have an always winning mentality, so the battle resulted in Shirotora's win but he gained her respect as at one point he almost defeated her but she showed experience beats raw power. Academically he had passed 12th standard by taking board exams [exams given by 10th and 12th students annually country-wide where the board of education gives out the result.] He completed his basic army training in Punjab and the blood clone was coming back a week later, in all he was ready. Physically also he developed from a scrawny kid of 4"11' he grew to 5"5' and had built up some muscles. [For the torso and muscles refer to 'KSI's body during boxing matches'].
After a week Manjot came back with Naruto and Dhriti hugged him tightly, as if her grandson just had fought on the battlefield and come home. After some time Manjot left the house as he had some other work to do too. So after they left, the original Naruto appeared with Kohaku and Shirotora as they were ready to dispel him.
"Are you both ready?" Shirotora asked, to which both of them nodded.
"Ok Naruto, the original one do the following hand signs and say 'kai'." Then she went through 'Tiger-Hare-Dragon-Serpent-Ram' and said, "Before that, draw some blood to start the ritual."
Naruto, the original one, bit into his thumb and drew some blood and then did the hand signs and said 'kai'. All of a sudden there was a big Chakra pulse before the clone disintegrated and Naruto collapsed on the ground, foam coming out of his mouth and violently shaking on the ground.
Seeing that, Dhriti was in a panic mode and Shirotora had to calm her down.
"Dhriti calm down!" Shirotora ordered but Dhriti roared back
"CALM DOWN! My grandson is having fits and you want me to calm down!"
"Nothing has happened to him."
"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?!"
"BECAUSE I ANTICIPATED THE REACTION BY HIS BODY!"
Hearing that Dhriti visibly calmed down and looked at Shirotora and ordered, "Explain."
"Naruto's mind is receiving Six months' worth of information and his body is changing due to the physical activities he did there. So as a result, he is foaming from mouth and his body is in a shutdown mode as it is incorporating the clone's physical and mental conditions."
"How much will it take him to recover?"
"Well for a civilian to would be an instant death, same goes for a genin and a chuunin, an average Jounin, four months with a high risk of going into coma. For an Elite Jounin, two months and a medium risk of going into a coma. For an Uzumaki and a jinchuuriki, one month with a low risk of going comatose. But, since he is both a Uzumaki and a jinchuuriki, two weeks and no risk of going in a comatose state, most he would get is a high fever."
"Jinchuuriki?"
"Oh, yeah, he did not tell you yet, right? It is not my place to tell you about that but one thing that I could tell you is, that, it is a major reason for his shitty life." With that said both the mother-daughter duo left, leaving the grandmother in deep thought.
She was sitting in the bedroom where Naruto was carried to. She was in deep thought. She knew Japanese, so the word 'jinchuuriki' meant 'power of human sacrifice' so she could see and piece the puzzle together and get a rough picture of his early life. The power of human sacrifice meant he had some power he never asked for. Due to that power, he was ostracized and most probably his education was stunted so that he could not develop his power and he was most probably manipulated to keep him loyal.
Her sad kind eyes looked upon Naruto as she ran her hand through his hair, "You poor child, I do not know what you have gone through. Hope god helps you and holds your hand in the future."
Those two weeks saw her calling Abhijit to her house to check Naruto's condition. He declared that it was flu and he would be bedridden for a good chunk of time. Also, Parvati cooked food for Dhriti while she was taking care of him as predicted he woke up after two weeks groggily.
He groaned and fluttered his eyes as he woke up after two weeks with all the memories of the six months assimilating in him. It took a big toll on him as he was not conscious for about 2 weeks, though the experience from the clone was helpful as he felt more strong and durable. But his senses were not working as he was seeing blurrily and when he tried to stand his hands and legs were giving out. So he started slowly, first by getting his vision in order, after squinting and widening his eyes many times he could see things better, next was to get his hand and arm strength back, so he lay on his stomach and tried to do a push-up and after many tries, he could do five consecutive successful push-ups. And now to get his leg strength back, he tried to stand but his thigh muscles were like jelly. So, standing and walking were difficult but after 10 minutes of struggle, he could walk around the room like a hospital patient and then he heard something clattering on the floor.
Twenty minutes before said incident
For the past two weeks, Dhriti felt the loneliness in her life that she felt when her son and husband left her. For some time she did have her granddaughter but she also required constant human presence in her life, especially in her old age. So when Naruto Uzumaki came in here, it was like a blessing in disguise. But as if the universe was taking her test of compassion and patience, the kid turned out to be a paranoid person and a cold one too. So after poking and prodding about information she found out about his name and that he was an orphan. So from that day, she wanted to be a mother figure in his life, hence she took it upon herself to bring him out of his shell.
Then after some time, for quite a time he disappeared on her which scared the living being out of her, but when he returned, he said a line that triggered her, 'Why do you care?' She knew those familiar sets of words because those were the same words spoken by her son, so as if getting vivid flashbacks she snapped. And then when realization dawned on her of what she had done she thought that the damage would be irreversible, but somehow it brought him out of his shell, sure there was mistrust from his side but the relationship slowly built between them and when she started teaching him, she was introduced to a whole new world in front of her.
The system of the shinobi world confused her a bit, but one thing she knew was adaptability, so when she was told about this whole new world it intrigued her, and she wanted to know more about it. The jutsus fascinated her but above all that, Naruto Uzumaki as a person was someone she now had a more solid and firm reason to help after seeing how he helped her own granddaughter and she could say that she now had a grandson. So after what happened in the previous two weeks, she just prayed to her lord for his good health and long life.
As she woke up in the morning she only wished that he would also wake up so after doing her morning rituals she went to the kitchen to bring a plate to carry some medicines but then she heard some strange sounds coming from his room, so she went to check on him and saw him walking and she was in so much shock that she dropped the plate she was carrying, which got Naruto's attention.
Present Time
"Hey, grandm-" Before he could say anything Dhriti crashed into him and hugged the life out of him. Due to his height growth, he was now a good few inches taller than her so he could feel her ragged breath on his shoulders along with that he could feel wetness on his shoulders implying that she was crying. After properly hugging him she started to ask him questions about his health rapidly so he had to calm her down.
Once she was back on her rational senses, she first called Abhijit, who immediately came for the check-up and asked him basic questions like, 'How was he feeling?', 'How did this happen?' etc. Naruto knew so he put on a game face, he answered them in half-truths so that his real identity would not be busted. After Abhijit's check-up, he advised Dhriti to give Naruto a light breakfast. Then Parvati and Shiv came to visit them and after Shiva asked about his health and Parvati mothering him up both of them sat down with Dhriti and Naruto to have breakfast. After they left, the day was spent in relative silence with what Dhriti could guess, him being in deep thought. The lunch was also a similar affair so was dinner, she could see that he was in deep thought so after dinner, she asked him, "What is going through your mind Naruto?"
As she anticipated Naruto was clearly in deep thought, thinking about whether he should tell her about his past or not. But after contemplating, when he saw the warm reception he got from her he thought about telling her the whole truth so when she asked him, he got the proper opportunity to tell her about himself.
[WARNING: I AM NOT GOING TO MENTION THE FULL NARUTO EARLY STORY, SOME GAPS WILL BE LEFT ALONG WITH WHICH PHASE OF THE STORY I AM ON, AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE PAST CHAPTERS BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF WRITING THIS CHAPTER AS IT IS GETTING VERY LONG! ALSO, THIS INCLUDES THE INFORMATION ABOUT BIJUUS SO YEAH…]
"Yeah, but let's go to the living room and sit," he said, as both of them did that. Then he continued, "Grandma, I am going to tell you about my past and please do not interrupt me while I am speaking." She nodded at this and he started.
"Before talking about my past I want to tell you about the sentient beings of our nations also called the bijuus …[Starts explaining about bijuus and jinchuuriki]… so, that being said, let's jump on 14 years ago on 10th October …[tells the Kyuubi attack and fourth hokage sealing the Kyuubi]… guess who that unfortunate child was, it was none other than me. So as you can guess my early stage of life was pretty much shit …[describes his early life]… so when the third hokage came to me telling me that if wanted to join the academy or not, I said yes …[proceeds to describe his academy life]… then came the day of graduation …[Mizuki incident]… so I was happy that was getting a team …[Team 7 missions from graduation to starting of chuunin exams]… It was the chuunin exams, meaning I could prove myself but …[Chuunin exams arc]… after his death, I was very sad not knowing what to do then Jiraiya came to tell me he had this mission …[Tsunade retrieval arc]… after that Sasuke suddenly challenged me I did not know why but hey if it means shutting the bastard up I am down for it …[Sasuke retrieval arc]… So with my chest recovering, I started to contemplate my life decisions …['The Escape' chapter flashback]… and then I left the village to get to wave …['Where the sea meets the land' chapter and 'Can I be your grandson' chapter before meeting Dhriti]… and that is where you found me." He finished.
The silence that followed after that was tense he was emotionally high and was completely expecting her to call him names like 'demon' or 'monster' and when he felt two arms wrapped around him protectively, he emotionally broke down.
Dhriti could only hold him, while he cried on her. She was in shock at how low people could stoop for power and what life he had gone through. In her mind, Naruto was the bravest child she had ever come across, and was proud to call him her grandson. She was thinking that if Minato Namikaze was her child, she would have beat the living shit out of him, because of what he had done though from what little he told her about Kushina Uzumaki, in her books, she had high respect for such woman. As for Jiraiya and Kakashi, she had a strong dislike of them due to their perverted nature but was a bit disappointed in them as to how they handled the situation. As for Hiruzen and Tsunade, she was on the fence with them, on one side was the duty to their nation, and on the other was the life of a child who did not even ask for it.
After he calmed down a bit she gave him water and then soothingly in his ear said, "You are a brave child and I am very proud of you."
"Why?" he rasped.
"Naruto tell me, if water is filled in a glass, does the glass become the water?" She questioned.
"No." He timidly replied while shaking his head lightly.
"Then why would I see you as the Kyuubi? For me, you are Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze or better yet Ranvijay Singh Agarwal, the grandson of Dhriti Agarwal and I am very proud of you."
With that, the remaining tear dams broke in his eyes as he cried and hugged her, while she guided him in his state and slept with him that night while wrapping his arm protectively around him while he slept like a baby.
Naruto Uzumaki in his life had a lot of conversations, some awkward and others comforting but that night for him was comforting as the biggest weight from his shoulders was lifted.

Two Hokages' Apprentice
________________________________________
As the next morning came, Naruto woke up groggily and felt something around his body, as he moved to see what it was. He saw Dhriti hugging him and then he remembered the last night's conversation and smiled as he finally had someone who cared for him without having a hidden motive behind it. So he hugged her and thought, "I love you, Grandma, I love you so much."
After sleeping for half an hour long, Dhriti woke up to see, Naruto holding her. She smiled knowing what Naruto had gone through but was still so strong-willed. She woke up from the bed and went to her room after which she went into the kitchen to make a hearty breakfast that day. After 10 minutes, Naruto woke up in his room feeling light due to the late-night conversation and felt much happier than he was. As he left the room and approached Dhriti, he hugged her tightly. She lightly patted his back. "Thanks, Grandma."
"You're Welcome. Do you want breakfast?" He nodded
"Ok, go sit on the table." He does that and starts thinking, about what might be the scenario in his birth village.
Elemental Nations
Jiraiya was panicking as the deadline was crossed and he had to still find Naruto or else he would be declared rouge and this could spell disaster for both Naruto and the Village. As he traveled around the nations and found out about his exploits, from the land of tea to wave nations and if they declared him rouge, suspicions would be raised and there would be an investigation, which would lead them to find how poorly they treated him and the economical backlash would be bad, especially after Suna-Oto Invasion.
A dark part of him blamed himself for coaxing into his sensei's word and leaving him in the village and getting busy with work so much that by the time he returned, he assumed that things could turn for the better but the cold hard reality of his negligence hit him hard. Also, this dark part wanted him to see the village crumble for what they did to his grandson but he knew he was still loyal to the village and could not let this happen.
He knew if they declared Naruto rouge, it was like handing him over to Akatsuki on a silver plate as with his skills, he would not be able to fight against them. So when he was given a summon order by the Hokage herself, he was shaking and was thinking of ways to extend the search time.
Meanwhile, in the ROOT base, Danzo was not happy. The stoic man thought that the jinchuuriki could be found easily, but in the past six months with all his resources spreading around the whole elemental nations, the hunt was getting difficult. So, when he got summoned by the Hokage, he was also ready to postpone the declaration.
The past six months saw Tsunade change into a different person, she took her responsibility more seriously. She no longer took shit from anyone and made sure to let people know that she was the Hokage. When she first took the job, she knew Jiraiya wanted to take him on a training trip for three years and eventually break the news about his parents and themselves, slowly assimilating themselves into his life. But as her luck would have it, she again lost someone who she truly loved, making the tally up to 10. First her grandfather, then her parents followed by her granduncle and then her brother and then her grandmother and then her lover and her son and daughter-in-law, now her grandson. It is as if gods hated her and never wanted her to be truly happy.
As she was thinking this, she thought about her three apprentices, Sakura, Ino, and Hinata. As she took all of them in, she was shocked by what they knew, so she had a lot of work to do, normally she would not even bat her eye before pulling out of teaching them but she had to do it as not only they were the future but also they were children of influential people, so it would look bad on her side to deny them, so, she had to suck it up. Although it was not a bad investment, as they were progressing at a good speed. Hinata was slowly coming out of her shell, while Ino was getting more responsible while Sakura her star student still had some fan girlish tendencies, but she thought that it would slowly wear out as she grew older.
Now after these six months, with Jiraiya and Danzo having no idea where Naruto was, she had to make the hardest decision of her life, by adding her grandson to the bingo book. So she gave a summon order to both Jiraiya and the Advisors to come to the Hokage's office in a week.
A week later, after a generic council meeting, she escorted the Advisors to the office, where Jiraiya was already waiting. After a signal, the ANBU hidden in the room disappeared. Tsunade walked up to her chair, sat, and took a deep breath before loudly sighing and saying, "So, you all know why we are here. Naruto's name will be written in the Bingo Book today, we will be doing it discreetly so that no one knows about it and eventually release the information to lessen the impact."
Jiraiya was ready to protest against the decision but the protest came from an unexpected person, Danzo as he protested, "Tsu-hime, this would be a very bad decision for the village, and would have a massive backlash." Seeing that he got the attention of the room, he continued, "If we release this, all the other villages will go on a hunt for him. And as his mental state is, some other village might manipulate him to be loyal to them. Also, Uzumaki had a lot of respect from several of our allies so, if we release this information, the investigation would commence which would release information about his early life, which would impact us economically and seeing that the Kazekage is a great friend of Uzumaki, we might also lose a major ally."
Jiraiya nodded and said, "I agree with him, hime let us postpone it." Then Danzo jumped in, "Or better yet, we release this information to his friends. As we saw with the Uchiha's case, they might go after him. So let us release it after 2 and half years." Seeing that both the Advisors and Jiraiya were on one way which made some sense, she caved in and nodded, "Ok we do this, after two and half years, we release the information to them, and they might have the drive to save him and we bank on it. What do you say?"
"Well, it could work." Jiraiya said and Tsunade nodded, "Well, we will do this. The meeting is over." Everyone nodded and the Advisors left. Jiraiya then sat on the couch and Tsunade sat beside him. "You know Asuma and Kurenai are going to be parents." Tsunade started.
"Huh, the kid is going to a father? Time has surely flown. It was like yesterday only when we saw that brat and took care of him when we were Jounin. So when did you know?"
"Yesterday, she came to the hospital to get the pregnancy test and I got to know it."
"Sensei would have been proud of him."
"Yeah."
"What happened Tsu? What are you thinking?"
"He would hate us, right? I could see how disgusted he would be with us."
"You do not know if it would be true in the future."
"How do you know?"
Jiraiya stood up and threw five kunai. Five anbus drop out of the ceiling, and said, "Son of a bitch does not know the definition of privacy." She growled but Jiraiya chuckled and said, "I think the elder toads know where he went but thanks to my negligence, they are punishing me by not telling me." She had a glimmer of hope in her eyes, Jiraiya hugged her tightly and said, "Do not worry we will find."
She whispered back, "I hope so."
Ghosh House
The ongoing week was nothing short of frustrating for Naruto as the progress made was close to nothing. Once done with his chakra control training, he moved on to elemental control, with the help of chakra paper, he found out that he had an affinity towards wind. [Not explaining the working of chakra paper.] That is where he was introduced to Gensotora who will help him with training of element. At first, he was thrilled but now it was frustration, pure frustration.
This week he only had one teacher as he had finished his chakra control training with Tsuyotora and his physical conditioning was finished by both Sokudotora and Tsetsutora so, all that was left was sparring, which they did daily. His fuinjutsu training came to an abrupt halt as Inkantora only knew sealing till level six, so the only thing he could do was practice. He only now had Gensotora to help him. But that tiger irritated him to no end, he expected to go into elemental chakra training, but the tiger told him to meditate and read about the theory of the elements. Naruto was an Uzumaki so eventually, his patience ran out, but out of respect he endured and in this endurance, one thing that helped him was his mother's dairy.
When he read that, he felt as if he was closer to her. Even though he hated his father to the point that if he ever met him, he was going to break every bone on his body, he found his father's personality likable but his inner hatred, made him describe his father as a 'lanky millionaire sex offender' [those who got the reference do leave it in the review section] and when he saw his father's pictures in her dairy it was evident that he did look like that.
On the other hand, when he saw his other, she was one of the most beautiful women, he had ever come across. He had doubts in his mind as to how his father scored such a beauty, but when he read the diary, it was nothing short of a romance novel. From her being ostracized due to her hair color to getting kidnapped and her using her hair to use it as a signal and then his father coming, kicking the bad guy's ass and they fell in love. If he did not know better then, he would have dismissed it as any other cliché romance novel.
But with all the distractions, he felt that his training was getting stagnant. During the week he also remodeled his room, to be a bit more organized. Thanks to the knowledge of sealing, he made different storage seals with different jutsus and other things. To keep his elemental nation stuff secret, he used fuinjutsu to make storage seals in his wall and erected a barrier around it to protect it. To make it more foolproof he used a blood seal to secure it and gave access to only him and Dhriti. The rest of the week was a socially normal week for him, meaning hanging out with their neighbors or Abhijit or having philosophical debates with Shiva which now had him research Hindu mythology.
As the week passed his patience ran thin and now he wanted to learn more but he did not have the resources, then he remembered something very random, when he swept Shodaime Hokage's house, he found three separate scrolls that did not have any jutsus or records of history in it. They were scrolls with the name of Mito Uzumaki, Hashirama Senju, and Tobirama Senju, so he decided to open the Mito Uzumaki scroll, hoping there would be more lessons on fuinjutsu or anything related to it.
When he decided to open it, he was interrupted by Dhriti as she wanted him to the College Street area in Kolkata to run an errand, by the time he came home it was already 10 in the night, so not to wake up anyone, so he went into a secluded bamboo forest in the area and decided to open it as he thought the scroll might contain any trap. When he opened it he immediately recognized the sealing array and threw it away, as it was a summoning seal, and once the smoke cleared an old woman with twin buns and a purple diamond shape mark on her forehead. Naruto immediately recognized who it was and uttered, "Oh Fuck." As it was none other than, the woman who was the first jinchuuriki, the wife of Shodaime Hokage. She was Mito Uzumaki, in her living breathing flesh.
Suddenly a kunai wheezed past him, he quickly raised his hand in surrender motion and yelled, "Ma'am, do not attack me, I am here to talk!"
"Who are you, boy?" Mito raised her killing intent.
"Ma'am, I am an ally, and I know you might not trust me but please listen to me and let us go to a secluded place just 500 yards from here." Naruto pleaded. Mito sensed his emotion and sensed that he was in shock, fright, and desperation but in all, she sensed that he was telling the truth, and said, "Ok boy."
Then Naruto made a shadow clone, which shocked Mito as to how he made it, and then the clone walked in the front while he walked in the back with Mito walking in the middle. They reached a cave after walking 500 yards, then he said, "Ma'am can we get inside the cave so that I can explain myself." Mito nodded and both of them entered the cave and sat on a flat top rock both of them sat facing each other. Then Naruto started,
"Ma'am before I tell anything about myself, I wanted to state some facts about you please tell me if these are correct or not." Mito nodded, and then he continued, "Your name is Mito Uzumaki or Senju, you are the wife of Hashirama Senju, your granddaughter is Tsunade Senju, and you are the first jinchuuriki of Kyuubi no Kitsune and then for some time you took care of Kushina Uzumaki, the second jinchuuriki of Kyuubi no Kitsune." Mito's killing intent intensified and she said menacingly, "Who are you and how do you know this?"
Instead of answering, he started freaking out, "Oh shit! This is the real Mito Uzumaki! Fuuuuck!" This confused her a bit as to why was this kid who looked a bit like an Uchiha freaking out. Naruto was freaking out as it was the real Mito Uzumaki and he was done for so he started gobbling up his information and started speaking, "Ok, so, I am Naruto Uzumaki, and yes I know that you might not believe me, thanks to my black hair but you can sense me so see my chakra and also I am the third Jinchuuriki of Kyuubi no Kitsune." When he shared that Mito was in shock, so to prove his point he drew out some of the kyuubi's chakra and it confirmed to Mito that he was telling the truth and when she sensed his chakra, he was indeed Uzumaki.
"You are indeed a Uzumaki, but why isn't your hair red?"
"No, thanks to my father, and no he was not a Uchiha, I am originally a blond but I dyed my hair black."
"Dyed?"
"Hair Dye."
"What is that?"
"It is a chemical to change the color of your hair." She nodded and then asked, "Where are we?"
"Well ma'am, neither are we in Konohagakure nor we are in Uzushiogakure."
This confused her, and seeing her confusion he spoke, "Before, telling you about that I need to tell you my story." She nodded in willingness to hear him.
"So, I would not like to waste your time, and I will keep it short. During my birth, the Kyuubi attacked the village, before you ask how? My mother was the second jinchuuriki, her name was Kushina Uzumaki. As the attack happened, Mum and Dad while the furball was sealed inside me by my father, the Fourth Hokage. My father's last wish was that I get recognized as a hero for jailing the beast, which was fulfilled by Sandaime Hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi but the public reaction was fear so, for most of my life I was ostracized, in the academy, teacher tried to actively sabotage me. I started pranking people to get attention and discovered that I was good at stealth. Till that time, I knew nothing about my parents or that I was a jinchuuriki. I got to know about my responsibilities as a Jinchuuriki after I graduated. During my academy days, the Uchiha were massacred by their heir, for a reason I don't know but he left his twat of a brother, Sasuke Uchiha alive. How did I know him? Well, he was my teammate. That brooder would be always talking about if he did, that he would avenge the clan and kill his brother. The team missions were alright and did a lot of D ranks, some C, and even B and A ranks. Then came the chuunin exams, where that Twat got bit by Orochimaru, who went rouge some years after your death. During the final stage of the exams, and during that time Orochimaru killed Sandaime Jiji, so we needed a new Hokage and the fifth hokage now is your granddaughter Tsunade Senju. During the regime change that bloody twat abandoned the village. Since he was the last 'loyal' Uchiha, a team of our batch mates was formed to retrieve him. That mission went south and that bastard went rogue while shoving a lightning fist through my chest. During my recovery in hospital, I overheard the three advisors, Koharu, Homura, and Danzo plotting my banishment that is when I got to know about my parents. So, I sneaked to my parents' house from the hospital. On the way back I got to know about the scandal where I got banished and brainwashed to be their puppet soldier when I saw them together. Accidentally they might have spotted me so, I ran and then broke into your house, ransacked both your and my parents' house, created a fake scenario of my death, and then abandoned the village, the plan was to go to Uzu but due to a storm, I was flung out here to kind of another world or a broader world out of Elemental Nations. I was practicing fuinjutsu, and got to level six, I ran out of material so I thought the scroll with your name might have some materials so here we are." He finished his life story or rant.
Mito was disappointed about what had happened in the young man's life and said, "You are Kushina's son?"
"Yes ma'am."
Sensing that he did not want pity, she directly asked, "Young man what do you want to do now?"
"Well, I want to learn about fuinjutsu beyond level six."
"Well, how about tomorrow?" This shocked Naruto and he was speechless, he bowed and said, "Thank you lady Mito, thank you so much."
"Well, Naruto-kun do you have Hashirama-kun and Tobirama-kun's scroll." Naruto nodded and said, "Oh yeah." He took out both the scroll and threw it on the ground.
From the smoke generated, came out arguably the most two famous shinobi of the world, 'The god of shinobi' and 'the first hokage of Konohagakure' Hashirama Senju and 'The creator of village system' and 'the second hokage of Konohagakure' Tobirama Senju.
After some time, Hashirama spoke in a jovial tone, "Tobirama? Mito-chan? Is that you?"
"Yes brother, apparently someone has opened the scroll, we kept at our house," Tobirama replied while Hashirama nodded and turned towards Mito and said,
"Mito-chan, you look so old now." Both Tobirama and Naruto face palmed, knowing very well, that commenting on a woman's age, is known as the certain ticket to instant death. Mito's face turned into an angered scowl and bonked into his head and started reprimanding him, while the said man was sulking like a child, then had an emotional switch and the three of them started chatting animatedly.
This ticked Naruto, as he hated being ignored and wanted to get the attention of the three adults in the cave. "Ahem!" He cleared his throat loudly in the cave, effectively gaining the attention of all the people there. Hashirama spoke up, "Who are you, young man?"
Naruto looked at him and said, "I am the person who opened the three scrolls, my name is Naruto Uzumaki and NO I am NOT a Uchiha, I have just dyed my hair black [reference 'Menma Uzumaki' without the side bangs] Shodaime-sama"
"What is a dye?" Hashirama tilted his head.
Naruto groaned and ran his palm through his face. He forcefully smiled and forced out, "Sir, it is a chemical which, when applied to the hair changes its color permanently." Hashirama nodded.
Tobirama then asked, "Well, Naruto-san where are we, I could sense that we are not in Konoha, so where are we?"
Naruto sighed and said, "Well, Mito-sama already knows but I will repeat and please do not interrupt me while I speak, you may ask later." Then he proceeded to tell the same story he told Mito, and Tobirama and Hashirama were shocked to the core at what happened after their death. After he was finished, he again sighed.
"Young man, are you sure, that we fought Saru?" Hashirama asked while pointing to Tobirama.
"Saru?" Naruto asked.
"Hiruzen," Mito answered.
"Well yes, the pedo Orochimaru used so kind of jutsu, edo something jutsu," Naruto answered.
"Edo tensei no jutsu?" Tobirama speculated.
"Yes, that jutsu, so he was fighting you guys and then he died. I do not know much of the details of his death."
"So now Tsuna is the hokage?" Hashirama asked
"Yes, grandma is the hokage after my father."
"Grandma?" Hashirama asked in an excited tone.
"Not biological, I just call her to spite her, though she was kind of a grandmother figure before me going rouge."
"Oh."
"Naruto-san you said, that the Uchiha clan was massacred, could you elaborate on what happened?" Tobirama then asked.
"Well, when I was in the academy, we heard that Sasuke's brother, who was the heir and in the ANBU massacred the clan, after crumbling under pressure. When I was in the hospital, the advisors said something along the lines of the Uchiha clan betrayed the village, so I do not think the official reason was the real reason." Naruto answered.
"Okay, so where are we Naruto-kun?" Hashirama asked.
"Well sir that would be complex to answer so I think it would be better to rest today, then tomorrow morning I can explain where are we." Naruto said and then continued, "You guys are shadow clones right." All of them nodded and then Naruto started searching for something around his body and found a seal, then he took out a sealing kit, which intrigued the rest of the people there. He then started drawing a matrix on sealing paper, Mito recognized the matrix he was making and was impressed by the speed and precision he was drawing the matrix. He then applied his chakra through it and then proceeded to make two more matrices.
Naruto asked, "So where will you be living?" Hashirama smiled and then proceeded to do hand signs and pushed the ground with his hands 'Wood Style: Wood Cabin Jutsu', "Well, that takes care of that."
"This is an overpowered kekei genkai" Naruto childishly exclaimed, which started rounds of chuckles from the adults. "Well, these are chakra pumpers, give you guys a long life." He said that and showed the three seals and gave them to them. "Well sirs, ma'am, have a good night." He said and left and then left.
Once he sneaked into his home, he went to his room and hit the bed, slept, and then he suddenly woke up in his mindscape, "Well, well, well, my jailor, how was it meeting that bastard and that bitch, interesting right." Kyuubi sniped.
"Kyuubi, it has been a while since we chatted." He said in an even tone.
"Oh it has been a while, but now you are here and we are chatting." He snarked.
"It has, but knows that we are talking, I wanted to know something." Naruto queried.
"What do you want to ask brat?" Kyuubi snarked.
"Well, I want to ask where the fuck are we? Because like when that metal rod hit me, it felt like I passed through something." Naruto asked.
"Hmm… The brat does have brains." Kyuubi was secretly impressed but wanted to poke him, "So brat what do I get from answering your question?"
Naruto did not want to play this game with Kyuubi, "How about both of us get to Elemental Nations, and kill that wanna-be Madara Uchiha?" he countered in an even tone.
That shut Kyuubi up and then he relented, "We crossed the veil, brat."
"The veil?"
"For your simple-minded understanding, it is a barrier that is surrounded by a barrier of chakra, keeping it away from the rest of the world."
"So why is the veil ever created?"
"I do not know. It was before my creation."
"Ok, also can you sense where the veil or the elemental nation is?"
"Yes, brat."
"Well, that is good. We can go back when we want."
"So, when will you go back?"
"Once I am done with training by Mito-sama, which also leads me to ask another thing."
"What is it brat?"
"I want the memories of Madara Uchiha from tomorrow."
"Hmm… Fine brat, you will get that."
"Thanks furball." Naruto wanted to get the final quip and left quickly leaving behind an enraged fox, "YOU FUCKING BRAT!"
Naruto that night slept a bit more comfortably knowing that there was someone who accepted him. With that, he now also had a mentor who could teach him more and a way to his homeland.
The next morning, Naruto next morning woke and the first thing he did was to summon Kohaku, once she appeared she asked, "Hey what did you summon me now?" She asked in a normal questioning tone which surprised Naruto a bit, "Huh? No more sassy tone? Well, that is good." He thought and then he spoke, "Kohaku, I need a short favor."
"What favor?"
"I need you to tell Pa and Ma that I will not be training with them for a week or a maximum of two."
"Huh? Why?"
"Just tell them, if they want a reason tell them, I found someone very big, and for some time, I will train with them."
"Oh ok" and with that she left, while he did his morning ritual. Then, he ran down to the living room, where he saw, Dhriti just going to the kitchen to make breakfast. "Hey, grandma." He greeted her and kissed her scalp. "Hey, I need a favor."
"What do you need?"
"I need ten rupees, got to buy something and I will eat breakfast outside today."
"Wh-What? Why?"
"Sorry, I cannot tell you, it's a secret."
Dhriti could see a certain fire in his eyes, so she relented but she had faith in him. "Ok." She handed him 10 rupees and kissed his cheek, "Be safe ok."
"Yes, bye Grandma."
"Bye Naruto."
Naruto ran out of the house and then he went to the nearby market to go to the library. Before that, he went to a restaurant, spent 3 rupees on breakfast, and then he went to a library cum stationary, where he bought a world map (political), a political map of India, and a political map of West Bengal with 4 rupees. Then he left for the bamboo forest before that he again went to his house.
"Oh, Naruto you are back early!" Dhriti said.
"No, Grandma, I wanted to take something and will leave. Also, I would not be home till the evening."
"Oh you would not be here for lunch," Dhriti said in a downtrodden tone. Naruto sighed and said, "Hey grandma, I know we are not spending more time together, but I promise it is temporary." Naruto said in a comforting tone.
"Ok but be safe out there. Alright?" Dhriti said in a concerned tone. "Alright." He replied and then left.
He then secretively went towards the bamboo forest, so that no one could discover the Senju family. After making sure no one was nearby he went towards the caves where the wood cabin was situated.
He knocked on the door and was welcomed by Mito, "Come, come, Naruto-kun." Hashirama and Tobirama were also there.
"Good morning sirs." Naruto greeted them. Hashirama jovially greeted back, "Good morning young man" while Tobirama nodded his head.
"So, I believe you have so may have questions for me from yesterday." Naruto started the conversation and then Tobirama joined in,
"Yes Naruto-san, I was asking where are we? It is not Konohagakure. I have gone out and seen many things that were new to me and also that people here do not have any kind of chakra." Tobirama asked him.
"Well, that is true. Truth is that we are outside of elemental nations." Naruto
"What?!" Both of them were a little shocked.
"Yeah as outlandish as it seems, I do have the necessary proof for that." He then took out the maps and put them on the table, first, he spread out the map of the world and said, "Ok as I was telling you, the elemental nations as we know is not the complete world, this is the real map of the world." He pointed towards the map, "The thing is that something is hiding the existence of our nation." As outlandish as it seemed both of them realized, that he was telling the truth as they sensed that there were no people with chakra here.
"Ok, then where are we?"
"Yeah coming to that, like the land of fire, there are various nations here, totaling up to about around 225." This shocked them a bit, "And we are here." Pointing towards India. Then rolled up the world map and took out the political map of India, "So, this is the country we live in, in this country different states and territories sum up to 32. And we live in here" Pointing towards West Bengal, then he took out the West Bengal map while keeping India's Political map, "In West Bengal, we are here in Digha." All of them nodded in understanding.
"So, young man do you know, how will you go to the nations?" Tobirama asked
"Well Kyuubi could sense the nation, so I am going to trust him."
"Are you sure this is a wise move?"
"Well sir, since both of us are stuck and both of us have one goal that is similar so yeah, and my initial plan was also simple, Go to Uzu, hope that there are some training scrolls, and then train for 3 years along with the fox's help with seeing, Madara Uchiha's memories to learn some jutsus, and then kill that son of a bitch wanna be."
"Wanna be?"
"Oh yeah, I did not tell you about the whole incident of my birth. You see when my mother was giving birth, since she was a Jinchuuriki, the seal was a bit or more weak than ever but then so Uchiha popped up, claiming to be Madara Uchiha."
"What?!"
"Well he was fake, how do I know? Kyuubi told me since he had Uchiha blood but was not Madara and also he ripped the Kyuubi out of Mum and then put him under genjutsu with some other kind of Sharingan, it was not your usual type of one or two or three tomoe Sharingan. But I do not know the name of it."
Hashirama then joined in with a serious voice, "Mangekyou Sharingan, it is called Mangekyou Sharingan."
"What?!"
"Before Madara left the village, he and I had a conversation, where he told me about another level of Sharingan called the Mangekyou Sharingan, this level could control any type of tailed beast. He told me, that to get to this level you had killed someone you dearly cared about. In his case, it was his younger brother Izuna Uchiha." He said
"Son of a BITCH!" Naruto yelled in realization.
"Naruto-san?" Hashirama asked in concern.
"During, the retrieval mission, that twat Sasuke told me something along the same lines as this. Now I wish, I ripped the Rasengan through his bloody chest." Naruto angrily said.
"Rasengan?" Tobirama asked, while Naruto subconsciously formed it with one hand and showed it to them. "It is amazing." Hashirama said in awe while Tobirama dissected the jutsu, "It had violently rotating chakra, compacted in a small ball, if hit accurately it can cause death. Young man that is an amazing jutsu."
"Thanks but I do not take the credit for it, it is my father's," Naruto said.
"Hmm… How about this young man, will you also train under me?" Hashirama proposed.
"Huh?" All of them were dumbstruck. Naruto was especially shocked because he did not expect the proposition but hey, if you are getting free food, you do not deny it. "Bro-Brother! Are you serious?!" Tobirama exclaimed.
"Well yes, since I have nothing to do and Mito-hime here will teach him, so why not me?" He said while scratching the back of his head and then he said, "Well, you could teach the lad too! Tobirama!"
Tobirama hated his brother's happy-go-lucky nature and his childish nature. Though he also thought if he could help this child there might be an important incentive. This child told him that he was going to access Madara's memories, so, there might be a small chance that he might get manipulated by the dead man and also the Kyuubi may ride on this and release itself may cause a catastrophic disaster. So he thought, that to save himself from the impending doom of his plan, he would step into it.
"Fine brother I will help him." he sighed, while his elder brother was doing a child dance, "Behave brother!" He snapped. Suddenly Naruto saw the once-happy Hashirama Senju going into a bout of depression. "What the fuck?!" Naruto was a bit weirded out at the emotional switch and as if sensing his emotion, Mito put a hand on his shoulder and said, "Do not worry, this is normal." This got Naruto thinking about what had he got himself into.
After some time Naruto sat with the adults and discussed his training schedule, as it turns out Tobirama knew water and lightning jutsus, while Hashirama knew earth and water jutsus and Mito water and wind jutsus, so Naruto knew he hit the jackpot, he could learn water and lightning style from Tobirama, earth from Hashirama, wind from Mito and fire from Madara. He could see the advantage of being two Hokages' apprentices. "Well, young man how about a spar right now?" Hashirama proposed.
"Sure sir." He agreed
What followed was a beat down of a lifetime for Naruto which humbled his head a lot. Tiger style mixed with Indian Army mixed martial arts could not go up against years of experience of the god of shinobi, now he certainly knew why Hashirama Senju was called the god of shinobi. The spar lasted only 5 minutes which he could only defend while he could not even get a hit on him. Now Naruto very well knew the meaning of the term 'There is always a bigger fish in the sea.'
And now he was more than ever determined to learn from them. The rest of the day was spent in sparring, first Hashirama, then Tobirama, and finally Mito. This was done to assess his aptitude as a Shinobi. That day he could only drag himself toward home. He knocked on the door.
"Nar-Naruto! What happened to you?!" Dhriti exclaimed in concern.
"Training and Humbling" was the only response he could give and he dragged himself towards the bathroom. Took a shower and somehow sat on the dining table and ate his dinner.
"Are you sure, you are alright?" Dhriti asked in concern.
"Yeah Grandma, right now the only thing I need is sleep." He said in pain.
"Ok but are you sure this is alright?"
"Grandma I know you are worried, but this pain is a little price for what I am gaining."
"Ok, be safe fine grandson."
"Yeah, love you, grandma."
From the next day, he was ready to gruel himself in the ground. The first week was more of the assessment and theory as the three of them tweaked around with him and then they were ready to start but here Naruto was hit with a major roadblock. Naruto was given the condition that he could not use his shadow clones, this was a major handicap for him but hey he was ready to do just that, if it meant to get stronger. Then one day after not summoning the tigers, Shirotora summoned herself in between a session, "My, my, as I live and breathe, Mito-sama in a living flesh." Said the chief tigress. "Do I know you?"
"Oh, I am the daughter of Ohotora."
"Oh, you are Oho-chan's daughter!"
"Do you guys know each other?" Naruto asked
"Yeah, I was the last summoner before you became a new one."
"Oh ok."
After chatting a bit Shirotora left knowing that her new summoner was in good hands. When he started his elemental training, he found out that Gensotora's theoretical knowledge did help. As with his affinity training, it turned out that except for his wind training, the rest four were not going so well. The first stage of wind training was splitting a leaf, for lightning was generating it between two fingers, water was to make ripples in a stream and earth was pumping dirt out of the Earth and burning leaf for the fire affinity. Out of the five, the only exercise that showed results was the wind one, where little progress was shown.
The next two months were rigorous training but it did bear fruit. Mito discovered Naruto's sensory abilities. Along with now teaching him about fuinjutsu now she also taught him how to use his sensory skills proficiently. During these months, she helped him understand the connection between fuinjutsu and the human body also both of them dabbled in juinjutsu and turns out it was not that much of a hassle. With that Tobirama was helping him with kenjutsu and he was training in dual wielding, also his endurance was increasing as the sparring time now is 7 minutes. Along with it, Hashirama was helping with Senju style taijutsu and he was dabbling into the Uchiha style also. The breakthrough during these two months was that he mastered the first level of each exercise. He could now split a leaf between his two fingers and make ripples in the stream while pumping a lot of earth, burn the leaf, and generate electricity between his fingers.
May and June were a bit difficult for Naruto as he learned 10 C rank jutsu, two for each element. Water prison and water bullet for the water affinity, Great Breakthrough and Wind Bullet for wind affinity, Electromagnetic Murder and Lightning clone for lightning jutsu, Fireball, and Phoenix Sage fire for fire affinity, and Mud wall and Stone pelting for earth affinity. Naruto, in these months, had officially mastered levels 7 and 8 of sealing along with sensing precisely over 750m and was now ready enough for on-ground missions, this is when he got his first kill and it disturbed him a lot that is when both Dhriti and Mito said the same thing coincidently about his first kill, "How do you know you are not a monster and just a human? It is when you hate and fear yourself after killing. It tells you that you are still a human and not a monster." His dual wielding was now very proficient, and the Senju style was now assimilated it his Taijutsu style, Mito offered to teach him Uzumaki's style of fighting. Still, he refused saying he wanted to fight with his unique style. He now completed the second stage of his elemental training. He could now split a rock or tree for his wind affinity and could shape the earth he was pumping out and could now burn a tree and also could charge electricity through conductors and make a whirlpool inside a stream.
Next couple of months he learned more c rank and 7 b rank jutsus, Fire dragon jutsu for fire affinity, false darkness for lightning, hidden mist technique, water dragon bullet for water, mud spikes for earth and pressure damage, and wind cutter for wind affinity. Naruto was now being taught about space-time jutsus, for levels 9 and ten of fuinjutsu. He had become a master dual wielder now along with his endurance increasing to 10 minutes a spar, during this time Tobirama told him about the harsh reality of a shinobi, this was when his mental endurance technique by Tobirama had started and he had now incorporated the Uchiha style with his taijutsu technique and found out that it was a perfect counter for the Senju style. He finished the final forms of elemental training, controlling fire from a candle for fire affinity and cutting the waterfall for wind affinity, pulling water from the stream into the air for water affinity, and lightning resistance, and passing lightning through his body for lightning affinity and shaping the inside of the earth for earth affinity.
September and October, he learned 10 A-rank jutsus, Blade of Wind, Swift Wind Wall for wind affinity, Lightning Transmission, Thunderbolt for lightning affinity, Swamp of the Underworld, golem for earth affinity, great waterfall technique, Water Dragon for water affinity, ash pile burning and fire dragon for fire affinity. Naruto finally had mastered all ten levels of fuinjutsu, something that made Mito extra proud that he mastered it at the young age of 16. He now could get some hits on both of the Hokages and started calling them sensei. Also these two months he had started the advanced level of element mastery. With the help of Tobirama, he could now draw water from thin air. For Earth, knowing the sand separating technique he could now separate different elements from the earth. He could now create and control a vacuum for his wind affinity. For fire and lightning, he fused science with chakra, for the fire, he burned the hydrogen of the atmosphere to raise the temperature of his fire and for lightning, he adjusted the frequency of his lightning, and accidentally recreated the famed black lightning of Sandaime Raikage. During this time Mito pointed out that Rasengan was only a chakra-based jutsu, Naruto wanted to hit his head as to how he missed it. Thus he started adding elements to his Rasengan, more specifically Wind and Lightning.
The last two months of that year were dedicated to polishing his skills and at the end of November, he created Rasenshuriken and Vanishing Rasengan both being wind style and lightning style Rasengan respectively.
"Young man, it was a fun time training you." Hashirama said while undoing his wood cabin jutsu, telling him that it was the end of the road for themselves then he continued, "You asked me one day, when do you know you are a shinobi? I know have an answer. You become a true shinobi when you have someone to protect, someone you can give your life to." Naruto was sobbing a bit, but a hand was put on his shoulder, he said, "Young man, no crying. You know both sides of the coin. Best of luck for your future." Another hand was put on your shoulder and Mito said, "Kushina would be very proud of you." With that, all of them dispelled themselves. Those last seven words opened the floodgates, that night he came back late night and he cried himself in the night.
He was proud to call himself the two Hokage's apprentice but did not know if he could call himself a proud son.

Creation Of The Forbidden World
________________________________________
Naruto woke up the next morning, a bit downtrodden. For the second time in his life, he felt true loss. For the first time in his life, he had felt the loss of a mentor. The past year was a blast for him in both his personal and professional life. As his strength grew, so did his mental maturity had also, grown. Many whacky had happened during his training, the first was obviously to meet the three of them. He was at first awestruck by the trio but as the year came to an end, he was a bit underwhelmed. He thought that Shodaime-sama will be this imposing figure but when you know him a bit well, he is for a lack of words a simpleton with a childish nature, for the god of shinobi he did not have any mean bone in his body and was a lovable goofball. The same could be said for Mito-baa-chan as she insisted he calls her, most of the time she was a patient woman with a motherly vibe but at times she could be a hardass. The same could not be said for Tobirama Senju as the man came off as a total hardass with a vendetta against the Uchihas', but over time he had a great amount of mutual respect and admiration for the person
During the time training, he learned a lot about the mentality of a shinobi. During this period he started his bout of vigilantism as a practice for on-ground missions as a shinobi. He knew he needed a costume since he was very popular in the locality. Thanks to Dhriti's connection with foreign nationals, she always received gifts from different countries. One of them was G. by Marvell Comics. He loved the costumes of Snake Eyes and Shadow Striker, so he made a costume that combined both the costumes of Snake Eyes and Shadow Striker. One week into his work, Dhriti had caught him suiting up. This had her grilling him for an hour but after that, she relented and gave him blessings for his work. A week into work, he only prevented minor theft, pickpocketing, and robbery. But a week in his job, he took someone's life. The vivid imagery of that rapist still haunted him. This hampered his daily life and training. Both Mito and Dhriti saw his body language and due to having military backgrounds both knew he killed someone. Both of them individually talked to him about this incident.
The next week, they decided to try and control kyuubi's chakra but it backfired hard. Mito being an expert in Fuinjutsu, the seal was easy for her to crack and make a key for it. So when she loosen up the seal a bit and Tobirama said something to trigger him to draw kyuubi's chakra, the malevolent chakra seeped through and overtook his conscious and made him berserk, thankfully Hashirama was there and he used his wood-style to contain him and suck out the poisonous chakra. That day he learned something that, he might be an average shinobi but he was a shit jinchuuriki.
Tobirama saw it as a big red flag. Emotion was a big hindrance in the shinobi business. He saw that Naruto could be easily emotionally manipulated, so he took it upon himself to hammer him to reign in his emotions during the battlefield. At first, it was extremely difficult for Naruto to reign in his emotions, it took him months but he was improving, but he always lost it, whenever there was a below-the-belt comment, he lost it. And it took him more than 9 months but there still were instances but it was exponentially less. This was what generated a mutual respect between a teacher who despite being a hardass was a realist who did not want his student to return in a coffin and a student who is ready and hungry for anything the teacher is ready to teach. Along with that the fact that both of them thought that Uchihas' were stuck-up pricks did help.
One day, Naruto brought a tattoo machine into the cabin, and this action confused Mito. But the moment Naruto explained his idea to her, she was genuinely impressed by his idea. They planned to mix fuinjutsu and juinjutsu to make a matrix that could emulate kekei Genkai and also make a matrix to counteract genjutsu. So they started making a matrix and since Hashirama was a kekei genkai user, the inner workings of an elemental kekei genkai were easy to understand and therefore it was easy to make a matrix then during the application part, they used, the juinjutsu's mind-matrix connection was used to make a retractable matrix and then was tattooed onto his right chest in the form of a tiger to give them homage. For the genjutsu, Tobirama contributed by putting him in S-ranked genjutsu, which acted both as training and as a testing for the matrix. Once done, they made a minuscule tattoo on his right cheek's topmost whiskers.
So when he activated the seal they looked were functioning great on his body and they now emulated ice release, smoke release, and many more. [For his looks, for the genjutsu one, when unraveled looks like Monkey D Dragon's face tattoo, it ran from forehead to chin. And for the kekei genkai tattoo, when unraveled it looked like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's Shoulder tattoo, it starts from his right chest and finishes just after his elbow.]
Their loss did hit him hard but what lessened the impact was his family and friends. The whole year was fun, though he did have some weird experiences. After honing his sensing skills, he started to sense everyone. When he sensed Shivansh, it frightened him, it felt like destruction itself. When he sensed Parvati, he felt warmth. This did raise alarm bells in his head, as he read about Hindu mythology, which stated that Shiva was the lord of destruction and Lady Parvati was the goddess of marriage and family. And the name 'Shivansh' meant a part of Shiva, so very much they could be the divine couple. Hey, he had seen tailed beasts, so seeing gods was not much of a shocking thing.
Regardless of that, he still had a tight bond with the couple and also he had a brotherly relationship with Abhijit to the point, they would go for random 'tea and cigarette' breaks. One of the bad habits he picked up was smoking cigarettes. But his best relationship was with his sister when she de-boarded the train, she ran and gave a tight hug to him while saying 'I missed you' repeatedly. For that month, he only focused on her. From the bounties he had hunted, he had racked up a good fortune and then he was now spending it on his sister. After she went, Dhriti's solicitor visited her but the weird thing was they needed his signature, he gave it knowing that he trusted Dhriti. Then in October and November, it was a festive season for the family, whether his birthday was on the 10th of October Shrishti's birthday on the 17th of October their Grandmother's birthday on the 5th of November, or the Durga Puja, it was wholesome.
Naruto left his bed, and went straight to the bath, while talking in the shower, he thought about his relationship with Kyuubi. Since he was being mentored by Mito and Hashirama. He heard the amount of hate speech that he even did not hear from the villagers. But, the amount of hatred he had towards Naruto had died down a lot. So, when he started viewing the memories of Madara Uchiha, there was no added comment from the fox. One thing he noticed in the memories was the ideological difference between the Uchiha and his peer Hashirama Senju. One wanted cooperation while the other wanted autonomy. He also saw why the ghost of Uchiha turned into a monster but something that confused him was the tablet, as Madara told Hashirama about the contents, weirdly the Kyuubi looked uncomfortable, but he also felt it was weird as to how would genjutsu bring eternal peace. But one thing for sure, he had seen two sides of the coin which was the good, the bad, and the ugly of the shinobi world.
He then went down to the dining room. After exchanging greetings, they ate after which Naruto asked Dhriti, "Grandma, do you know how I can get a passport?"
"Why?"
"Well, I was thinking that I wanted to explore the world, go look around you know."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Do not worry, I will visit you during June and Durga Puja and it is only for a year."
"Ok, fine, I will make the necessary funds and the passport."
"Grandma no need for the funds, just the passport."
"Are you sure about that? You know I can sponsor your trip."
"No need grandma, I have the necessary funds from my side job" She knew what 'side job' meant.
"You would not budge would you?"
"You know me so well," He said while making a kissy face.
"Yeah, whatever you brat! I will make some arrangements and you will get it in two weeks."
"Yeah, that is perfectly fine. I will be leaving by March."
"Fine, but we will require your birth certificate and tenth and twelfth board certificate."
"You leave that to me. Also, I will have to make about 5 of them." She was shocked at the outlandish request, and then she shook her head.
"You will be the death of me, you know that, you brat!"
"Yeah whatever, you old hag!"
After that, Dhriti made contact at the Indian Passport Office, with her contact, so that she and he would not get arrested and put in jail for identity fraud and corruption. While Dhriti was contacting the Indian Passport Office, Naruto went into the locality to get a board certificate for tenth and twelfth along with a birth certificate. Then as he got the three important papers, he started forging five sets of these papers. All of them were without his original name, the names he chose were, 'Nakul Sachdeva', 'Ranvijay Singh Tabbar', 'Vidyut Kumar', 'Shankar Das', and 'Shakti Ghosh'. Once he was done no one could differentiate between the real and the fake.
Two weeks after that day, the official visited their house and the deal was made at the cost of fifteen thousand rupees. Two weeks after that, in the mail, five passports arrived. This gave the green light to his world tour. That night he slept and woke in his mindscape to talk to his tenant, the Kyuubi no Kitsune.
"Hey Kyuubi," Naruto called out.
"So after a long time, my jailer visits me, oh I am so happy" Kyuubi sardonically answered
"Well pleasure is all mine but you know it has been a month since my beloved mentors died, had been mourning."
"Oh my condolences, I am so sorry I was not there to kill them."
"Yeah, should have called you but I am not here for our usual chit-chat, I need your help."
"What do you want?"
"Can you right now sense where the veil is?"
"Yes"
"I need you to tell me, about let's say Konohagakure."
After thinking sometimes he said, "About Uzushiogakure"
"Hmm, thanks Kyuubi."
Kyuubi was shocked that his jailer appreciated him. After waking up, he compared both the elemental nations map and world map, and after calculating and triangulating a bit he could point towards a country or better yet a group of islands, either Indonesia or Malaysia. So he booked a ticket for Indonesia, to start investigating the whereabouts and how to get in the nation. He did dabble around the idea of using his summons but scraped it as in the long run, it would be a lot riskier for him to get caught. As he did not know where he would summon himself in the nations, it might so happen that, he might summon himself inside Konohagakure and be caught.
During February, he debated heavily with Shivansh on similarities and differences between Hindu and Greek mythology, Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Shinto. During these debates, he passionately spoke about Hindu or Shinto mythology, which rubbed him the wrong way. It was like Shiva was not advocating for the Hindu religion but it was like he was the deity Shiva himself.
So, he now started investigating the nitty-gritty of Hindu mythology. From reading the Ramayana to matching it with the science of carbon dating. From that, he discovered that the Ram Setu which stretched from the coast of Kanyakumari, the southernmost part of India to the northernmost part of Sri Lanka dates back to 7000 years. Also, he read about Mahabharata and he wanted to visit the historical valley of Kurukshetra. There was news of said sightings of god in different news. So he started cutting out newspapers of such sightings for such gods and started to connect the dots but, he still could not pin it on Shivansh and Parvati Das.
February passed and after temporarily halting his investigation, he was ready to leave his house to travel around the world.
"Do you have to go?" Dhriti asked
"We had this conversation right?" Naruto asked.
"I know but I still want to worry about you."
"Hey, it is not like I am going to fight a war, it is just a tour, you know what? I will write a letter the moment I reach Indonesia fine."
"OK, but Travel safely and come back to me safely." She said while tears filled her eyes.
"Hey no crying okay, I will come back safely. Ok" She could not find her voice, so she nodded. He then turned to the neighborhood couple and said to Parvati,
"Take care of her for me, Okay?"
"You don't have to worry. You have a good journey" She reassured him. "Travel Safely," Shiva said.
"I will," He said to the couple and sat in the Taxi to go to Dum-Dum Airport and take a flight to Indonesia's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
"Aunty, he had to leave the house." Parvati soothed the downtrodden Dhriti as she replied "I know but I do not want him to leave, he is still so young."
"You care for him a lot."
"Yeah, He is more than my grandson."
She was downtrodden for the whole week as now she had no one in the House and it was empty. She now waited for April to come, as he would return for two weeks then again leave, and then come for a whole month in June. At the end of the month, she received a letter in her post, she quickly took it and opened it then she sat on the table, took out her glasses and started reading.
________________________________________
Dear Grandmother,
Hey. How have you been? I do not know when you will receive the letter. So, there will be no good in mentioning where I am right now. Hence, do not reply to the letter also, just know I am safe and sound. Also currently I am in Malaysia. I know I told you that I am going to Indonesia, I went there stayed for three weeks and then I am here in Malaysia. During my stay in Indonesia, I met this guy, Iman Bashir, a cool guy. Turns out he has a big business in the southeast circle. He and I became good friends. So during my stay in Indonesia, he told me to come to Kuala Lumpur [the capital of Malaysia, for idiots who do not know] and I agreed. During my stay there, I first visited Jakarta, a cool place, but politically, the situation is heated. After a few days, I went to Bali for a week, and let me tell you, what a beautiful place it is, loved it, I have some pictures of my travel, you will find them in the envelope. Then I went to the Indonesian part of Borneo Island, a naturally beautiful place, calming for the mind. I will fly you here once I am done with my world tour. I stayed there for two weeks after meeting Iman, and now I am in Kuala Lumpur, a very interesting place, that is all I can say about the place, as I have not yet traveled around it, so cannot review it. And a very important thing, I have sent you 101 rupiah to donate to Shiv Temple for your long life, because one thing that I am sure of is that I will live for eternity, but I do not know about you. Also along with that, I have sent you 101 ringgit for again donating to Shiv Temple for good luck because lady luck always favors me, so, this time I thought about you.
Love you.
Your loving grandson,
Naruto Uzumaki
________________________________________
The letter made her shed a few tears, knowing that her grandson was alive and doing well. The situation in Indonesia did concern her but hearing from her grandson made her happy and then she took out the envelope and found a couple of pictures of him and one with the Iman Bashir fellow. He looked like a generic guy of the Indian Subcontinent, with brown skin, black eyes, and hair, along with a thick but properly trimmed beard, overall a normal guy. Then she looked at Naruto's photo, he looked like he was enjoying himself in the photographs, one of them was taken at a bar, meaning that he was drinking, looks like she had to straighten him up.
Meanwhile two kilometers away in a house, a person dials a telephone,
"Hello," he heard from the receiver who had a thick British accent.
"Hello, the target has left the country. You are okay to scout now."
"Are you sure you want it now mate, you said you wanted to kill her in October, so what's up with the rush?"
"She is the widowed wife of a decorated brigadier, so she has time to time army surveillance. Her grandson has a bounty hunter side business, which might I say he does greatly, and also, how about the fact that I paid extra for this?"
"Hey, no need to get angry mate, you are our old customer and also we dropped her son and daughter-in-law and made it look like a terrorist attack."
"Did you kill the kid?"
"Mate, the brat got lucky. This time we will finish her off after killing the old hag."
"Fine, but, when does your scouter come here?"
"In about two weeks. Why?"
"Postpone it two July. Her grandson will return in two weeks and he finds out no one is safe."
"Fine, you do you fam. Cheers mate." And then he cut the call.
"Soon. Grandma. Soon." He said while folding his hands in front of his face.
In Malaysia
Naruto had a blast for the whole month. Once he landed in Indonesia, under his fake passport name 'Ranvijay Singh Tabbar', it so happened that both his and Kyuubi's sensory power was going haywire. It was so that they were sensing large chakra spots from three positions, one from the south of Jakarta, the second from the north, and the third from the east. Thankfully, he could reduce the spots to two of them as the east spot was a fake one since Borneo Island was towards the east of Jakarta. He first travelled to Bali, a tourist hotspot to check out the Southern Chakra spot. There he found nothing but also he found that their culture was very much influenced by the Indian Culture and there were cave paintings of something like the gods descending to the mortal plain, again flaming the suspicion of the identity of Shivansh and Parvati Das. Though he could not find anything about the Elemental Nations, he did meet Iman Bashir, he was a great guy. They quickly became friends and turns out he was going from Borneo Island to Kuala Lumpur, and since he had to also travel there, both of them decided to go together so after two weeks in Borneo, they both now were in Kuala Lumpur.
"Iman" 'Ranvijay' called him.
"What is it Ranvijay?"
"Brother, I will be leaving Kuala Lumpur today."
"Why? Is there any problem? Do tell me."
"There is no problem, but I will be traveling to Sumba. I will be there for a week and then will be going to India for two weeks."
"Ohh. So after that where will you be after those three weeks?"
"Well, I will be going to Japan."
"Oh! I will be in Japan then. I will go to Japan after two weeks, and stay there for three months after that I will be returning home to the US."
"US, what a surprise! I will be going there after three months."
"What a surprise! Then I insist you to come to my house."
"Sure brother!"
After that, he left for Kuala Lumpur International Airport to his destination Waingapu Airport in Sumba Island. The next day, he landed at Waingapu Airport on Sumba Island in Indonesia, that week he found out the whereabouts of the veil. So two days before going to India, he took a boat near the veil, and then the first thing he did was through a beast gale palm and he was confirmed that it was a huge barrier. In that abandoned sea, one could hear the mad laughter of one Naruto Uzumaki. Since it was evening, he went back to the island, vowing to come back and find a way to go back to his homeland. The next morning, when he came back to that place the veil went missing. He did feel a chakra pulse in the night, but did not know it vanished, he just screamed in agony, at the hard work of five weeks gone in a night.
"Brat." His tenant called.
"What is it?!" He screamed on that boat.
"I can feel it."
"Feel what?!"
"I can feel the veil! You brat! And Calm Down!"
He calmed down after the outburst of Kyuubi. "Where?" He asked.
"I can sense it, towards the northeast, but it is faint."
"Okay, no problem. It means either towards South Korea or Japan. It is great." He said optimistically
In West Bengal, India
On the 15th of April, Dhriti got a letter. She again took out the letter and read it,
________________________________________
Dear Grandmother,
Hey, how have you been? Hope you are doing well. Again, do not respond to it as I do not know when this will reach you, so yeah… Anyway, after spending a week in Malaysia, I can say it is a good country, though I have only traveled to Kuala Lumpur, it was a good experience. Then I visited the island of Sumba in Indonesia, good weather spent a week here, and I will be returning soon. Also, I left a surprise with Shivansh da and Parvati Di. Go check it out.
Your loving grandson,
Naruto Uzumaki
________________________________________
After she read that letter, she went to Das's house. She was greeted by Parvati who had mischievousness in her eyes which was caught by Dhriti and she was a bit suspicious of her.
"Oh Dhriti, what happened?" Parvati feigned her surprise at the old woman's appearance on her doorstep.
"Hey, um, I got a letter from Naruto saying that he left a surprise here." She enquired the young woman.
"Oh yeah, it arrived today only." She said and led her to the hall of their house. As she saw the surprise gift for her, her knees gave out and tears streaming down her eyes, she was supported by Parvati.
Flashback, 5 hours ago
Naruto had just arrived at Dum-Dum Airport. After reaching the airport, his foxy brain gears were spinning, so he had an idea. His idea was that he would personally disguise himself as a postman to give a letter to Dhriti that said that he had a gift for her in Das House, and the gift would be him. So instead of going to his house, he went to the Das House and rang their bell while hoping that Dhriti would not be in their house at that time.
"Naruto! You are back!" Parvati exclaimed and hugged him tightly.
"Hey, big sister." He hugged her back.
"So how are you? How have you been? Are you alright?" She rapidly fired her question.
"Yes, yes, and yes but let me get in and I will tell you everything." He said as she led him in. Shivansh was also pleasantly surprised by his arrival but welcomed him. Then after freshening up, he was settled down to a good breakfast and there he explained his plan to them, and needless to say they were in his plan. So at midday, he dressed up as a postman and rang the Ghosh House and immediately ran to their house to their first floor's window to spy on her while changing into his normal wear, and then he saw her coming towards the Das House. He told the couple and sat down at the dining table with his foxy smile. He heard Dhriti and then when she saw him she had tears in her eyes.
Present Time
"Hey, grandma." He said while standing up, and then Dhriti crashed into him while checking him to see if he was alright or not and the rapid firing questions. He chuckled seeing the old woman acting like a young woman fretting over him and then she started rapid-firing questions about his well-being.
"Grandma, grandma, I am alright. Calm down and then I can answer your questions." This calmed her and then she questions about his health, which was answered by him reassuring her that he was alright. Then he took out some souvenirs for the Das couple and then it was decided that they would have a hearty lunch at their house. So the two women started cooking and the aroma only filled their stomachs. During their cooking, the men started a conversation about his trip to Indonesia and Malaysia. After discussing the culture and political heat in Indonesia, they had a hearty lunch, which made Naruto utter that there is no place like home. They stayed there till the evening and then returned home. He straight went to his home unpacked and then showered. Then he went to the dining table. The menu consisted of classic Punjabi food with Butter Chicken, Naan bread, and Dal Makhani. He told her to not make any dessert as he brought them from Indonesia Kue Putu and then dinner commenced, which was a silent event as she knew he needed a well-deserved rest.
"So, what are your plans after your recent visit?"
"Well, I am currently thinking that I will as I told you be here for about two weeks and then go to Japan for a month and then will be returning here during Shrishti's summer vacation, and then I will return to Japan and from there I will go to the US and will be here for Durga Puja till your Birthday."
"Oh, so you have a tight schedule right?"
"No, my schedule is always open for you and Shrishti."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Always."
The two weeks pass in a breeze and again he leaves for Dum-Dum Airport. "I will see you in June. Bye. Love You!" He said.
"Stay safe and send letters." Dhriti tearfully said.
"Sure" With that he left for Dum-Dum Airport to take his flight to Haneda Airport. Three weeks after his departure Dhriti received a letter from Naruto with a Japanese stamp on it.
________________________________________
Dear Grandmother,
Hey, how have you been? Hope that you will not be sulking. Cannot say, when you will receive the letter but I will return on the first of June. Anyway, I love it here in Japan. The culture here is just like Elemental Nations, well, except for the Shinobi system. The weather is alright, the people are magnificent and polite. First I landed in Tokyo and took a bullet train to the Tohoku region and then a flight to Hokkaido. It was absolutely beautiful there, stayed for a week, and then I went to central Tokyo, a busy place for sure but it was clean. While travelling I did visit the Historical sites of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was inspirational to see how the people had rebuilt themselves from the atomic bomb attack. And now I am in Kyushu, it is a lovely place here. No need to reply I do not know where I would be so yeah…
Love You
Naruto
________________________________________
Naruto when he landed in Tokyo, his sensory power was again going haywire. Thankfully this time for him there were only two chakra spots that he sensed one in the North and the other in the South. Once he landed in Tokyo, he directly went to Hokkaido to check out the chakra spot but it was a ghost there so he knew it was down the south. Then he remembered that Iman was there in Japan. So he thought he would meet them. Therefore he called him
"Iman. Brother!" He called
"Ranvijay. Brother!" Replied Iman
"Brother, I am here in Japan, where are you?"
"Oh, you are here! I am in Tokyo"
"Oh, I am in Hokkaido."
"Oh then come here, I will show you around."
"Sure! Then will be there."
With that, he left for Tokyo. There they went for a tour of Japan or more of the mainland and visited many places. The irony he found was the 'Nara deer park' in Nara and he found that not only they had their Nara clan or as he called them the clan of lazy asses, here also the Nara was once a clan in the Sengoku known for their laziness and ingeniousness. Then he visited the provinces of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After two weeks he said goodbye to Iman to go to the southern island of Kyushu and as he would have it the veil was present outside the southern borders of Kyushu and he started researching about it more. The properties he noticed were that non-chakra people could go in but were faced with violent storms which are the cause of all the deaths of the infiltrators but when he tried to touch it, his palm immediately burnt. So after marking the place on his personal world map, he left for Tokyo to go to India. During this visit, Iman said something that stayed with him. He said that a person can either live in the shadows of other people or make their own. This sparked an internal debate inside him. Who was he? The son of Yellow Flash and Red Habanero, the student of the two hokages' or was he Naruto Uzumaki? But before the soul searching, he knew he had a little sister to take care of along with a grandmother.
The heat of June was unbearable for the Indian people. Many of them, liked to laze away in their homes, doing nothing, but for a young Shrishti Ghosh, she was extremely excited as not only did she get to go to her grandmother's home but also to get pampered by her elder brother. Last year, her brother pampered her a lot but he did look a little tired every day and then there were their new neighbors, Shivansh Uncle, and Parvati Aunty. They were very good people, once she told them about her orphan status, Parvati started to mother her. So, when the train halted at the Sealdah, she was excited to again be greeted by her brother. But the excitement soon faded away, when she only saw her grandmother and not her brother. "Hey, grandma. Where is big bro?"
"Well, he is not here right now."
"Where is he?"
"He is not right in Bengal. He has got outside of India."
"Like in foreign nations?!"
"Yes!"
"So, when is he returning?"
"I don't know sweetie."
That answer of Dhriti's downtrodden Shrishti. The whole day Shrishti was sulking as Naruto was not home. Though, she had fun with the neighbors, Naruto's absence and her mood down for the day. After eating snacks, she was going to her room when she heard the bell ring. "Shrishti! GO GET THE DOOR!" Dhriti instructed her to get the door. So Shrishti in her world went to open the door. When she opened the door, she saw the person who was there and bawled into the person.
Flashback 3 hours
Naruto had just landed at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Airport and was tired so, instead of planning another elaborate homecoming, he took a taxi back home with his bag pack and a small suitcase full of souvenirs from Japan in it. As his luck would have it, the taxi got stuck in the traffic. He therefore took a nap in the taxi as the two-hour-long drive became a three-hour long drive and he had a good nap which rejuvenated him. He woke up when the taxi arrived at Digha Railway Station. He was visibly excited as he was going to see his sister after 7 months. Ten minutes later he had arrived at his destination, gave his fare, and took out his luggage and then he rang the doorbell. Once he heard Dhriti calling out to Shrishti, he was smiling knowing the first person he sees will be his sister. So, he saw the door open, he smiled while Shrishti saw who was there and bawled into him.
Present Time
"Big bro!" She hugged her tightly.
"Hey, hey, easy Shrishti." He tried to calm her down. "I am here."
"Where were you?" She pouted.
"Well, I was traveling the world."
"Why were you not there at the station to receive me?"
"The flight got delayed."
"I am not talking to you! Humph!" She said holding her head up high. Meanwhile, Dhriti was concerned as she told Shrishti to get the door and she had not responded yet. "Shrishti who is ther-" Dhriti was going to ask her but saw who was there, "Naruto, is that you?" She asked seeing the young man who was once scrawny, short-height, and injured to now a tall confident man with light beard markings.
"Well, if you know any other blonde-turned-raven guy called Naruto then no. Although, could I get into the house because little Miss Princess here wouldn't let me in." He jokingly said.
"Shrishti."
"What? He did not come to pick me up so, he does not get to go inside." She said in finality. Both Naruto and Dhriti shook their head and then Naruto put on his bag and picked Shrishti up with one arm while picking the suitcase in his other hand.
"Hey put me down!" Shrishti cried.
"You said you would not talk to me?" Naruto quipped.
"Yes! I am not talking to you." Shrishti said in haughtiness. Dhriti chuckled while shaking her head, seeing the interaction between her grandchildren. Inside the house, it took Naruto about two hours to butter Shrishti up to forgive him. Dhriti then came to him with a request
"You know, I just came back and now you want me to go out?"
"Yes, you little brat, and don't make it like you are going out of the country. You are going to the vegetable market, to get ingredients for the dinner. Now go, you idiots."
"Yes, oh mighty queen Elizabeth." He said mockingly.
"Brat, you have 5 seconds to get lost before I slap the shit out of you. You might be seventeen but I can still show you, who the boss of this house is." Dhriti threatened him.
"Yeah… Okay… Off to the market!" He said knowing any more jokes could land him in a lot of trouble. "Wait! Wait! Wait! I want to go to!" Shrishti nagged to go with him.
"Yeah sure she can come," Naruto said, while Dhriti agreed knowing that Naruto would be there to protect her. So the Brother-Sister duo went to the market to get the ingredients for dinner. After returning home, Naruto forced Dhriti to not cook as he was cooking dinner that day. After the food was plated, Shrishti was in awe of the food while Dhriti was impressed by him. The menu consisted of Chicken Curry, rice, some Japanese sweets, and traditional Indian sweets.
"This is YUMMY!" Shrishti exclaimed in delight.
"Yes, this is good." Dhriti also complimented.
Naruto preened at their praises, for the first time he did not want to go back, "Yeah, this is life." He thought. "Thanks. Finish up then I can give you guys souvenirs."
"Really!"
"Yeah, but eat slowly and then he will give you the gifts." Shrishti nodded at her grandmother and at till a full belly. After dinner, Naruto helped wash dishes with Dhriti. After that the family sat down in the living room and the Naruto unpacked the suitcase. "Shrishti, here are some souvenirs from Japan," Naruto said while giving a Pink Kimono with Sakura tree imprints on it along with some stationary and a bag pack. Shrishti excitedly hugged him and repeatedly said thank you. Then she went to try on the kimono he gave her, but since she was not Japanese, thankfully Dhriti had traveled to Japan and helped her to put on the Kimono. After her energy ran out, she went to bed leaving the elders in the room.
"So, what are you planning next?" Dhriti asked her. "Well, before that, here is a kimono," He gave her a white elegant Kimono with gold work on it. "And also a folding fan, along with that one hundred and one Yen for your good luck and long life."
"Thank you, honey." She said.
"You're welcome."
"So, your next destination?"
"Japan, for a month. Then I will be in the US till mid-October, then I will be here for Durga Puja and will be here till the first week of November for your birthday, then would be there till January."
"Hmm, well good luck in your travels grandson." She said while getting up, "Hey, grandma." Naruto said getting her attention.
"What is it?"
"Well, I wanted to ask something."
"Ask away."
"Is personal identity important? How can one get out of someone's shadow?"
"Is it about your shinobi life?" The look on Naruto's face confirmed her question.
"You know why people call me 'Army-Dida'? For a decent chunk of my life, I was under a lot of shadows, being the daughter of an army instructor, being the wife of an army brigadier and even being a woman. Something you need to know about building an identity is that, do you want that identity for the sake of it or is it because you have an inner calling that says to do it? Let me tell you something Naruto, I built my identity because I wanted it truly, not because the situation called for it. Listen to me Naruto, when you make your identity it is always permanent, you cannot erase it. Build an identity, that even your legacy is proud of my boy." She said and left while leaving Naruto in deep thought.
That night he slept on the couch while thinking about what Dhriti said. The month passed with him having fun. In the mornings, he would pamper Shrishti and have debates with Shivansh while hanging out with Abhijit while, at night, he was thinking about what Dhriti said that day. The month had passed and the family was at Sealdah, bidding farewell to Shrishti, it was a tearful goodbye but it was not over for Dhriti as she again said goodbye to her grandson after her granddaughter, as he took a train to Dum-Dum station to take the flight to Tokyo. Once landed at Haneda Airport, he called Iman,
"Iman brother!"
"Yes, Brother!"
"I am in Tokyo!"
"Oh, You are here! Where are you right now?"
"I am at Haneda Airport."
"Oh then wait there for 10 minutes, I am sending a person there to pick you up from the Airport."
"Oh ok sure."
After 7 minutes a black range rover rolled up to the main airport gate, "Holy Shit! The guy must be loaded!" Naruto thought while getting in the Range Rover and going around Tokyo. Once the car stopped, it was in front of a tall lavish building. He then saw Iman standing in front of the gate.
"Brother welcome!" Iman said while welcoming him.
"Thank you, brother, thank you."
"Now come on in." After going up in the elevator. They reached the 9th floor and then the elevator door opened. Then Iman opened room 751 with a key and showed around the lavish apartment, "Brother do you like it?" Iman asked.
"Hell yeah, it is one hell of a lavish apartment," Naruto said. Then Iman handed him the key and said, "For the rest of your stay in Japan, this will be your apartment."
"What?!" Naruto was speechless.
"What? You are my brother, so it is only right to get the best accommodation. Also if you have any problem, do not hesitate to call me."
"Man, Thank You!" Naruto said and hugged him tightly.
So the whole day, Naruto unpacked and rested in the luxurious apartment. He explored the apartment, it had a king-sized bed, a huge balcony, and a heated Jacuzzi, and so the whole day he was resting.
West Bengal, India
An anonymous person picked up a ringing telephone and put the receiver on his ear.
"Hello mate, is your little problem soldier gone?"
"Yes, he is gone. You can now get your man to scout the target."
"Okay, we will send him."
"If he is caught somehow can he get suspected?"
"Nope! Although he won't get it, if he gets then it would point towards a random gang in the United States of America."
"Ok, but make sure that old hag gets killed, along with that brat."
"Would be done, mate. By the end of November Dhriti Agarwal Ghosh would be accidentally killed."
"OK."
"Cheers mate."
The call cuts while he sings a nursery rhyme, 'Inky Pinky Ponky, Father had a Donkey, Donkey dies, Father cries, Inky Pinky Ponky' while playing darts on the image of Dhriti.
Tokyo, Japan
After a day of resting, Naruto first met Iman and had breakfast with him, he said that he wanted to explore the surroundings but he humbly refused, saying that he did not want to worry him. And then he started exploring and then he walked upon a forest called 'Aokighara forest' in the Yamanashi Prefecture. When he asked around, he found out about the grim reality of the forest and why it was called the 'suicide' forest. Although it was a grim reality, for Naruto, it was an opportunity. If no one came into the forest, he could do his shinobi exercise without ever getting discovered by locals and the world.
He then went deep inside the forest. After checking thoroughly that no one was there, and then he three times tapped the left bicep while passing chakra through it. A scroll popped out of his left bicep, it was a letter from Tobirama before, they dispelled themselves, and he secretly handed the scroll to Naruto. Now, Naruto unfurled it,
________________________________________
Naruto-san,
If you are receiving this scroll then it means we have dispelled ourselves or something has propelled us to dispel ourselves. First of all, it was a pleasure training you. You are one of my good students someone, and I will be proud of you to call you my student. You had the same fire in the eyes that Hiruzen and Danzo had when I first trained them. My first impression of you was the second coming of Madara Uchiha, the hate, and the cunning you had reminded me of that man. When you told me of your early life, my first reaction was that of disbelief, the dream my brother fought so hard for was dragged down the mud because of my students had filled me with disappointment. When you told me, that you were going to access the memories of Madara Uchiha, I knew it would not take much for you to convert to Madara's ideologies. And a jinchuuriki, especially that of Kyuubi with Madara's ideologies was something I could not allow therefore I started to teach you. At first, it was purely because I wanted to prevent an uprising of another Madara Uchiha. Once I started training you, I was genuinely impressed by your resilience and determination. Young man, I saw the future of shinobi in you. I know the bad blood between you and Konohagakure cannot be solved but I hope that you still have the humanitarian heart that most shinobi have lost in terms of loyalty and patriotism but you, young man do not ever lose it. As a token of gratitude for teaching you young man, I have given you some jutsus, use them properly.
Tobirama Senju
________________________________________
Naruto only felt pride reading the letter, knowing that the legends of the Shinobi world had acknowledged him. At the end of the scroll, he found some scroll that had, some Tobirama Senju classical, with some other jutsus that were kekei genkai related. One of them, which caught his eye was 'The Eight Inner Gates'. He had already seen the effectiveness of the said jutsu by Busy Brow and it was extremely effective, so he was excited to learn the eight inner gates. But then he remembered what Tobirama had said to him while in his apprenticeship: ' Before learning a jutsu, know about its drawbacks. No matter how powerful a jutsu maybe it will always have a weakness.' So he started thinking about the drawback of eight inner gates. While reading about the description of the jutsu, found out that it had one simple drawback, the jutsu is mainly taijutsu-based, so if anyone had a strong Ninjutsu defense like Gaara's sand, the jutsu would be effectively useless.
Then he had a borderline suicidal idea, that instead of learning the jutsu, he could make a jutsu like the Eight Inner Gates, but instead of only taijutsu, it would be an all-rounder jutsu, which covers all the basic aspects of Shinobi, Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, and Genjutsu as he did with Rasengan. He made Rasenshuriken and Kieru Rasengan (Vanishing Rasengan). So, he started first nitpicking the given jutsu. It took a hell of a lot of time and by the early evening when he decided to return to his apartment, he even hadn't deciphered the intricate details of the First gate but during his month of training, he learned the most important lesson 'patience', thus he decided to give it rest for that day.
From the next day, he formed a plan, he would visit various places in Japan, preferably dense forests, to not arouse suspicion. If he went to one forest every day, people might get suspicious about his workings and he might get caught. So he found ten forests to help him in his endeavor. The next morning after a short meeting with Iman he left for Bijinbayashi in Niigita, he booked a hotel for two days to do his research, and his decision did bore fruit as he, in those two days cracked the workings behind the first of the eight inner gates. He found out that the jutsu uses the Chakra to accelerate the body's metabolism and power which results in the Shinobi getting greater strength and stamina for a deathly amount of chakra, thus called a forbidden jutsu. Also, he found out that every gate affected or siphoned chakra from different places. For the first four gates, it was the chakra pool. The next two were from the outer skeletal system, for the seventh, it was from the muscular system, and for the gate of death, was from all over the body, effectively killing the person while giving him or her, an exponential boost of power.
After deciphering the theory, he came back to Tokyo, staying in his apartment and researching the theory in detail, it took him a week but he concluded that he would have to go through the dreaded and irritating training of Gensotora. So, the next morning, he left for the island of Kyushu, a place where he could train while keeping track of the veil. As he reached the island, he first searched for an inn to stay in Nagasaki while continuing his training. So, after finding a suitable place, he made a shadow clone, reinforced with enough chakra to last for his training duration. Once done with the clone, he sent it for sight-seeing and reverse summoned himself to Mount Taigahiru. After walking for a while he came to face in the face with Shirotora.
"Oh, brat, it has been a while."
"Yeah boss, it has been."
"So, why are you here?"
"I need Gensotora's help with something I am working on."
"Oh, you need Genso's help. He would be on that hill, inside a cave meditating." She said while pointing towards a hill in the mountain range. After some climbing, Naruto finally reached the hilltop and saw the cave. When he went inside the cave, he found Gensotora, who had just finished his meditation.
"Oh Naruto-san, it has been a while." Said the Tiger.
"Yeah Genso, again, I am extremely sorry for cutting our training sessions in the early stages but I had some work so, it couldn't happen."
"Ah! No problem, Shirotora explained to me about meeting Mito-sama and all, so it is not at all a problem."
"Thank you but I am here because I need your help."
"What kind of help?"
The Naruto proceeded to explain his plan of making a potentially SS class jutsu. During that time he gauged Gensotora's reaction which was not very emotional but he glinted with excitement in his eyes that he could not hide.
"Naruto-san, while it is not an impossible task, it would be very difficult. Are you sure, you are ready for this?"
"I am ready for whatever you throw at me!" Naruto said not knowing how much he would regret saying those words.
For the next two weeks, he was beyond pissed off. For Naruto Uzumaki, even if he had been trained down to the ground he would happily get up for more but with Gensotora, he was frustrated, first meditate for a long time (AKA till Naruto gets frustrated), and then read about chakra networks. This went on for a week. Even Shirotora could see his frustration, so she asked the tiger who caused it.
"Genso."
"Shirotora! It has been a while. Come, Come." He ushered her inside his cave, and then said, "So, what prompted the visit here?"
"It is about the brat."
"Who? Naruto-san?"
"Yes."
"What about him?"
"Why are you doing that to him?"
"Doing what to him?"
"Do not play dumb with me, we both know what you are doing." Gensotora then sighed and said,
"I am doing what is required, I have seen Naruto-san's battle intellect and ethics and with the things he is planning, he might need to use 'that' in the future, hence I am preparing him."
"Do you think Ma and Pa will allow him?"
"Allow him? No. But he will convince them."
"I hope you know what you are doing."
"Oh, trust me. I know what I am doing."
With that being said Shirotora left while Naruto entered the cave, "So Naruto-san are you ready for today's training?"
"Yes," Naruto said in a dead tone.
So, his stay in Japan was a struggle. Gensotora was testing his patience, whether it being his insistent on meditating or his giving the boring lectures on the theory of the five basic elements and the theory of the element-based kekei genkai.
West Bengal, India
At the end of July, Dhriti received a letter from her grandson, so she took out her reading glasses and read,
________________________________________
Dear Grandmother,
So how are you doing? Hope you had a good month, unlike mine. Honestly, I have never wanted more to do, more of the ground operations. Gensotora, the tiger I told you about is driving up the wall. During the whole month, I have done nothing but study theory and it is boring and frustrating. First I am doing meditation for 6 hours! SIX FUCKING HOURS! I mean who does that?! Then after doing that, I had to endure 8 hours of boredom, PURE BOREDOM. Anyway, I have somehow come out alive and survived the month. Now I am moving to the US with Iman. I will be landing in Los Angeles and then I will contact you after a month. Hope you are well and good.
Wishing for your good luck and a long life,
Your Loving Grandson,
Naruto
________________________________________
Dhriti wanted to spank Naruto so badly. Writing such appalling words (as she completely ignored her appalling language, she frequently wrote in her letters to her husband or her brother) though she almost wanted to pity him, getting to know him for the short time he was there, she knew his patience limit as he had the concentration of a butterfly. She so much wanted to write a letter responding to him but knowing his ever-moving locations, she could not send him any letter. All she could do was pray, hoping her grandson would be happy in his travels and successful in his endeavor.
Japan, Haneda Airport
While Dhriti was busy praying, Naruto was going through the security check along with Iman to catch their flight to Los Angeles International Airport in the U.S.
"Are you excited brother?" Iman asked Naruto.
"Well, let's see what the future holds." He said while handing over his boarding pass.
After a ten-hour long flight from Haneda Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, they finally landed. Naruto slept like a baby, the frustrations and fatigue of the past month got to him. The flight attendant had to wake him up. Iman had jokingly asked how had been his sleep. To which he replied, that he slept like a baby, and all of them laughed at that. Inside the plane, their other seat passenger was a middle-aged woman named Penelope Decker, although a slightly invasive person, she was a sweetheart. She said that she was a retired actress and had a daughter in the LAPD named Chloe Decker. The name did bring out a reaction from Iman as he had a blush on his cheeks and then she also said that she would introduce him to her daughter, which confused him, as to why a random person would introduce their daughter to him.
Los Angeles, USA
After landing at the LA International Airport, they parted ways with Penelope and went to Iman's house. While traveling, there was a building he was intrigued by. It was called 'LUX' when asked about it. He told him that the building was owned by someone called Lucifer Morningstar. It amused Naruto, that the Devil himself owns a clubhouse, the irony of the situation humored him, that the Devil owns the place of sin.
His reception by the Bashir Family was warm. From a lot of memories and travel of many pilgrims that said about the beautiful hospitality by a Muslim family, rang true. They fed him till his belly bloated. They insisted him to stay in their house for the next day. When Naruto told them about his interest in going around America and exploring it, Iman immediately insisted that he use his money to travel, but was met with strong resistance by Naruto. After long drawn debate they came to a middle ground that, while in LA, Iman would take responsibility for his expenses.
So, he was there for a week. During that week, he visited LUX and found out that club nightlife was not suitable for him. So after a week, he left for the East Coast and during the road trip. He resumed his rigorous training. He went from California to Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania and his final destination was New York. During that time he had cracked 5 stages of his super jutsu that he calls 'Eight Pillars of the Forbidden World' (nobody, asks how he got the name), each stage of the Jutsu is called a pillar. During his journey, he created 5 pillars (stages).
The first pillar was called 'Tekkai' [translation Iron Body, once accessed, the body becomes as hard as Iron. Then the second pillar was 'August Winds', which enabled him to control the wind without any signs. The third pillar 'Turbulent Waters' functions the same as wind so, do the fourth and fifth pillars, 'Raging Fire' and 'Obstinate Earth' respectively as they have the same function as the predecessor. However the chakra expenditure increases for the increase in each pillar. But one thing special about the jutsu was that he could access all eight pillars in a single pillar. For example, he could access 'Turbulent Waters' in the second pillar but it would not be as effective as that in the third pillar. Also, he could access 'August Winds' in the fourth pillar but the effectiveness would be the same as the effectiveness of the second pillar.
Once completed with his training, he spent some time in New York and had fun after the progress. There he met one of his grandmother's friends, Leto. She was one of the sweetest people he had ever met. But then he had to leave so he took a flight from John F. Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. He there met Iman and his family to say his temporary goodbyes and after staying for a day he left for Los Angeles International Airport to go to Netaji Subhas Chandra Airport.
While on his flight to Kolkata, Kyuubi called him, "Brat."
"What is it Kyuubi?"
"I felt the veil during your stay at that land."
"Where? USA?"
"Yes"
"When? During the start of my stay? Or, during my trip's ending?"
"During the start of the stay."
"Where did you sense it? Which direction?"
"Towards southwest direction."
"Hmm… So towards the Hawaiian Islands. Huh. Ok Kyuubi, we will check it out."
After a short layover in Doha, his day-long flight had landed. Thankfully, he booked a business-class flight, or else his back would have cracked. After landing, he took a taxi to Digha. There he was greeted with surprise when he entered his house. He was greeted with a surprise birthday party by Dhriti, Shrishti, and the Das Couple. He was then hugged by Shrishti. As he entered the house he met two unknown faces.
After greeting and talking with the known one, he met the unknown elderly couple, though looking at the old man, he could say that the man had a lot of life left in him, with the way he carried himself. Naruto greeted them while shaking his hand with the old man. He could say one hundred percent that the man was retired army personnel by the handshake. It was a good firm one.
"I believe introductions are in order," Naruto said.
"Oh it is, let me start," said the old man and then continued, "myself, Sam Manekshaw, a pleasure. And this is my wife Silloo Manekshaw." Sam introduced his wife.
"Oh sir, it is my honor to meet the legendary Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw himself."
"Young man, I am no legend. Legends are those, who have passed away, and I still have a lot of life in me."
"Haha, sir legends might be dead. Then let me rephrase, the living legend himself."
Both of them laughed heartily and then both of them started conversing with each other. After some time the rest of them joined in the conversation then Dhriti interrupted him, "Naruto, go freshen up then converse with Sam."
"Come on Dhriti, the lad came from a flight, not a battle, he looks fine."
"Yes, that is why you gave orders on the battlefield while Silloo still gives orders in the house." All of them cracked u, and then Naruto excused himself and went upstairs.
"He is a good chap, Dhriti."
"I know, Shankar would be proud to see him."
After freshening up, He came down wearing Kurta and Pajamas. They sat at the dining table and ate. After this, the Das couple left the house, while Naruto and Dhriti insisted the Manekshaw couple stay. After some back and forth, Sam called Pan Singh, his assistant, and told him, that he would be staying there. At that time Sam and Naruto started talking and found out he did a pilot course, which interested the field marshal. So, they made a plan that the next day they would visit the air base at Hasimara in Alipurduar, to see his flying skills.
"You are planning something aren't you Sam?" Silloo asked when they were in the guest room.
"What do you mean, dear?"
"Sam. Please do not play dumb. You are going to give the kid an honorary rank, aren't you?"
"Yes. Shankar was a good friend of mine, and if this gesture helps his grandkid, then I am going to do it."
"So, which rank are you going to give him?"
"The chap is saying, he has a pilot license and his body movement does say that he is a damn good pilot. Hence if he passes the test, I will make sure he gets an honorary rank of Wing Commander of the 16 wing regiment."
"Wing Commander?"
"Yes, if the chap does fantastic, I will contact Ved ['Ved' as in Ved Prashad Malik, the chief of army staff in 2000] and Satish ['Satish' as in Satish Kumar Sareen the then (2000) Air Chief Marshal of the Indian army] to give the kid Honorary Wing Commander of 16 wing regiment."
The next day after a good breakfast, Sam started talking to Naruto, "Well, Young man, are you ready?"
"Any time sir."
Sam then made two calls and then Pan Singh received them with a car and took them to Dum-Dum Airport. Once clearing the security, both the Field Marshal and Naruto were received by an Air Force officer, and they were escorted to a chopper to go to Hasimara. Once landed there, they were received by the base chief, Air Commodore Ashok Dharam Chhibbar,
"Field Marshal Manekshaw, an honor" Chhibbar greeted and then continued, "And you must be Naruto Uzumaki, the local vigilante. A great pleasure."
Naruto was shocked that he was famous, "I did not know, I was this famous."
"Oh trust me, young man, Thanks to you, the crime rate is a lot less. You do not know how much, you helped in preventing West Bengal from becoming East Pakistan and us military personnel interfering. And because of that we of the Indian Army and on behalf of Sir K.R. Narayanan, the president of India, Eastern Naval Command INS Netaji Subhas, Eastern Air Command and Eastern Command, I, Air Commodore Ashok Dharam Chhibbar give you, Naruto Uzumaki the honor of becoming Honorary Wing Command, do you accept?"
"Are you serious?"
"Trust me, young man, he is serious," Sam said.
"Well sir, what do I have to do?"
"Just so simple tests."
With that being said Chhibbar led them to the base where Naruto met a wing commander who led him for some general physical and written tests, which he aced (Showing his development in the 3 years), and then he was to spar with a Group Captain which for a shinobi was a cake walk. After that was a flight test with a helicopter 'HAL Parchand' and a Jet 'Su-30MKI' and boy did he have a field day with it.
"Field Marshal! He is bloody damn good" Chhibbar complimented Naruto.
"Oh I know, the chap is great!" Sam also complimented him, meanwhile a chopper landed at the air base, where Dhriti and Silloo were there.
"Dhriti, look at that jet," Sam said while pointing towards the jet.
"That's Naruto?!"
"Yes, Ma'am"
"So… why is he here?"
"Well ma'am, he will be receiving an honorary Wing Commander rank due to his contribution to the internal stability of West Bengal and Eastern India."
Dhriti's chest filled with pride, while the jet landed and the partner wing commander of Naruto came out to report, "Sir, Hon. Wing Commander is fantastic at flying."
"At ease commander and thank you for your report."
"Yes Sir!"
While all this was going on, Naruto was escorted inside to wear an Air Force uniform, for the ceremony. When he appeared, he was shocked by the presence of Dhriti, the Air Chief Marshal and General and the Chief of Army Staff present. He was presented with the rank by the chief of staff. Needless to say, the Durga puja ad Dhriti's Birthday was a blast for him. Thus his stay in India was fantastic. He then booked a flight to Hilo International Airport.
Hawaii, USA
The moment he entered the Hawaiian Air Space, he felt the chakra of the veil, thus confirming the fox's words. His current plan is to make a space-time summoning seal to travel from Earth to Elemental Nations so that he does not have to use summoning jutsu, every time he travels. Once landed he sensed the veil was present south from where he was, hence he took a boat to travel to the southern part of Hawaii to start his plan.
First, Naruto summoned Baatora for his plan to start. "Naruto-boy! It has been a long time! How are you?"
"I am fine Ma, what about you?"
"I am doing well too. So, why have you summoned me?"
Naruto then proceeded to explain his plan and the reasoning behind it.
"Hmm… Your plan does seem good, but where will put the summoning seal on this plane? It needs to be a secluded place, where no one will see you."
That is when, he remembered about a certain island, which is the most secluded yet easily connected place. He went to the Hilo Airport and booked a ticket to Oakland. Once reached, he rapidly sunshined over the water to reach his desired destination, 'Alcatraz Island', the place where the most dangerous criminals are kept. Once reaching the island, he cast an invisible genjutsu on himself and searched the island for a secluded place. After a good hour of search, he found himself in the perfect place, a secluded place where no guards were present and keeping surveillance.
He quickly summoned the old tigress. "Naruto-boy, have you found the place?"
"Yeah, and the seal matrix is also ready."
"Show me." He gave her the matrix, "Hmm… an Attraction seal layered over a homing matrix along with a memory seal. Well done."
"Thanks."
"Ok so let me put the receiver here." He slapped one of the seals on a rock in the cave. "Ok, I am ready, reverse-summon me."
"OK boy, get ready." They first reverse-summoned themselves to Mount Taigahiru then, they summoned themselves to a random place in the Elemental Nation.
Unknown Place
He appeared in the middle of a town. Naruto did not know, where he was, "Ma, transform into a street cat, and climb and sit on my shoulder." He said.
"Ok Naruto-Boy," She said and transformed herself into a white-furred cat and sat on his shoulder. Then Naruto saw a tavern and went there to find out where the hell he was.
He went inside the tavern and sat on the bar, "Excuse me, one bottle of sake."
"Such a young age to drink, you alright kid?" A man who was sitting beside him said. Naruto turned to see who it was and froze. "Hey kid, you alright? It looks like you saw a ghost." The man said looking at Naruto's pale face. "Yeah I am fine, sorry where my manners are, myself Keizo Obuchi," He said faking his name by telling the name of the current (during 1999) prime minister of Japan, because if he said his real name, his plan would fail as sitting in front of him was none other than his godfather Jiraiya of the Sannin. Naruto was thankful that his new look was disguising himself completely. He had grown his hair shoulder length and straightened it from the spiky form. Due to the density of his hair, it started curling down in length (For reference search 'Ranbir Kapoor Animal Look') and made a short bun while having a slight bit of hair down (refer to 'Ranbir Kapoor Hair Animal' and see the bun look) and also had grown a light beard.
"So what's with the pale face?"
"Nothing, it's just that you look a lot like my godfather." He said while thinking "The best lie is when it contains truth in it. Tobirama sensei you said this and it better be true."
"Oh… So, are you looking for him?"
"Yeah. He said he was in Wave Nation. So, I thought I would visit him, and got lost and do not know where I am."
"Well kid, you are in Tanzaku Gai, so you are pretty much near."
"Thank you. Sorry, did not get your name."
"Oh, my name is Minato." Jiraiya faked his name.
"Oh, thank you Minato" Naruto smiled while internally he was pissed off, "Motherfucker! Using my father's name as your fake name!"
So, after finishing his drink he ran and ran like hell so that if Jiraiya caught wind of his lie he would be a lot farther away. Jiraiya was a bit suspicious about Naruto in his disguise, but then his suspicion was raised when he started talking, after speaking with the young guy, he thought the guy was okay, but in his mind, all that was going on was finding his grandson, and he had to go to Konoha in a week, to be there for a very important announcement.
Near the shores of Uzu
After, escaping from the tavern in Tanzaku Gai, he made towards Wave Nation, and then from the port, he took a boat, and he did not crash into the veil that time. After a day of traveling, he reached the shores of his mother's homeland. He did not wander inside because of the time crunch. And then he found a remote cave and stuck the other seal. And then he again summoned Baatora.
"Naruto-boy is it ready?"
"Yeah, and I will be testing it."
"How?"
"First throw a rock and then throw me."
As he said, he threw a rock with his name written on it. And then after some time, he went in. Baatora sat there with bated breath, and then after some time Naruto appeared back and tossed the same rock with his name on it. "Well, the portal is working!"
"Thank the sage!" Baatora sighed.
"Hop on, we going to Alcatraz," Naruto said, and Baatora hopped on, and they jumped in the seal and both of them appeared on the other side of Alcatraz. "Ok Baatora, I need you to reverse-summon me to Taigahiru."
Mount Taigahiru
"Well, Naruto-Boy we are here." The old tigress said, while Naruto nodded and then he turned to her, "Hey, Ma, hypothetically can you revive a recently dead person." Baatora a little surprised and concerned by his question replied, "Well there is a seal, but why are you asking this?"
"Well… I have an idea. Like the eighth gate of death, I thought along the lines of this stage of jutsu, so, I need your help."
"Have you lost your goddamn mind?!"
"Come on please!"
"Fine, but I would not be responsible for your damn death."
"Thanks, also can you bring Shirotora and Gensotora, so you know, to keep 'it' in a controlled environment." He said with the 'it' in quotation marks.
"Uhhh! Fine! Shiro-chan Genso-chan, come here!"
After 3 minutes both the tigers came there, "Ma, what happened?"
"Hear what this idiot is planning?!"
"What, what are you planning?"
Naruto proceeded to tell them about his plan. Both Shirotora and Gensotora were shocked by his idea. "Brat, why do you want to die?"
"Hey I do not want to die but this is an interesting idea! Think about it!"
Gensotora had a certain glint in his eyes and prevented Shirotora from berating him, "Shiro, he does have a point, let us do it."
"Genso! What do you mean? This is certain suicide!"
"No, but let us perform it, Ma, please bring me the medical seal and Naruto follow me," Gensotora instructed. Both did as they were told and after some time all of them were in front of his cave. "Naruto let's start" Gensotora instructed.
"Seventh Pillar of the forbidden world: Merging Realities" Naruto called and suddenly his body started changing with his skin burning red and chakra encasing him. "Ok Naruto you have accessed the seventh pillar, now try the eighth." Naruto nodded and flared his chakra, "Eighth pillar of the forbidden world: Forbidden City" As soon as he said that his body shut down and after some time, he woke up in his mindscape with a very hostile fox, "YOU BRAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?!" the fox roared.
"What the hell happened?"
"YOU DIED YOU BRAT. YOU SHOULD BE FORTUNATE THAT THE TIGERS HELPED YOU!"
"Oh…"
"NOW GET OUT!"
Then the fox kicked him out of the mindscape and he woke up in the old tigress's room. He woke up groggily and reached for a glass of water. Kohaku heard some movement and went inside,
"Naruto! You are awake!" Kohaku cried.
"Yeah! Right now, I would like some water please." Naruto requested, and then he was greeted by the three of them.
"Naruto-boy, are you alright?!" Baatora cried out in concern.
"Yeah, I am feeling well, but what happened?"
"You died, and we slapped the medical seal on you and revived you" Shirotora deadpanned.
"Thanks for the revival." He said gratefully.
"No problem Naruto-boy."
"So…" Naruto started, while Gensotora continued, "it was a success. You have completed the forbidden world. Well done, Yoso no Naruto [Naruto of the elements]"
Naruto felt his chest swell in pride and then he said, "Thank you Gensotora."
After some time, when he was well, he then summoned himself to Los Angeles. After all his shinobi jutsus were done, he now wanted to enjoy the rest of the year exploring the United States. "Iman, I am here in LA."
"That's great, so where are you?"
"I am near LUX."
"Ohh… Wait there, I am sending my driver."
"Oh, you did not have to do that."
"No, you are my brother, thus you get the best."
"Thanks, man."
"No Problem."
After some time, a Lexus pulled to where Naruto was standing to pick him up. Meanwhile on the top balcony of the Lux, a man in a bathrobe was watching Naruto get in the car.
"Mazikeen, you see that person with blonde hair down there"
Mazikeen, a chocolate-colored skin, 5'4'' tall woman came towards the balcony, "Why, so you can get him in the bed too?"
"No, my dear Maze. That person interests me a lot. Find me all his information please." said the man.
"Fine, whatever Lucifer. I still do not get your interest in humans."
"Thank you, dear." Said the now-named Lucifer while he thought, "Hmm. He is one of their descendants. Are you a parasite like your ancestors? Are you as violent as your ancestors? Why are you here? Interesting…"
Iman's LA Mansion
Not knowing that a certain devil and a demon were investigating him, he was enjoying his time with his recently made friend, though he was a bit suspicious of him, as he thought that Iman was spying on him but he scraped the idea. For the first two days, he rested and toured around. On the third day, he was eating at the dining table when Iman and Naruto were having a random chat which turned to having tattoos. Iman being a devoted Muslim argued that Allah had made a perfect body for every person. Therefore having Tattoos is looked upon as disrespect to the creation of Allah. Naruto on the other hand countered in by stating the tattoos as a sense of belonging to a tribe or a clan. As their debate was going on Ruksana walked in with their food. Then they started digging in, while praising her cooking and resuming the discussion of tattoos, that time when he was telling them about having only one large tattoo, Ruksana pointed out another tattoo on the rear side of his neck connecting to the shoulders, this confused Naruto as he did not do any such tattoo. Still, for the sake of the conversation, he did not press on that matter.
After lunch, Naruto went into his room and then took off his shirt, and looked at the mirror, all he could make out was a small seal that was in the shape of the leaf symbol on their hitai-ate, this rang alarm bells in his mind.
He immediately put up some silencing seals and then created a clone, "Yes boss!" The clone saluted.
"Check the seal on my back."
"Boss it looks like a leaf symbol seal, it is a juin (cursed seal)."
"I know that much, dumbass. Can we remove it? Yes or No?"
"Let me see boss, grade 2 curse huh? Whoever put it on us did not want it to be broken, oh a memory suppression seal and a blood seal, huh Uzumaki blood seal, okay fine."
"So, what?"
"Yeah, boss, it is removable but the way it is made, the removal would disperse a lot of chakra."
"Okay, then make seven level eight chakra absorption seals and start the process."
"Yes, boss!" With that, the original Naruto took off his shirt and lay down on his belly while the clone prepared for the unsealing, "Ok boss I am starting the unsealing process." As he started the process, Naruto started to writhe and scream.
West Bengal, India
Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, another person/deity was writhing on his bed too.
The Said Person's Dream
The said person saw a corridor lit with red lights and a puddle of blood flowing under a pile of dead bodies. He could hear someone saying in Hindi
'When I went seeking evil,
I could not find any evil.
When I looked within,
There was no more evil than me.'
He saw a person, 6'7'', blonde hair grown to his shoulder, blood-red eyes, and with a weapon which concerned the said person, as it cost him and his followers a long battle to seal the said weapon. A weapon that could kill the Trimurti with ease.
He was jolted out of his bed by his concerned wife, "Shiva! What happened? That nightmare, again?"
"Yes dear, but do not worry. Go to sleep."
"No, I would not. You tell me what are you dreaming? All I hear from you is some male person in a bloodied Kurta wearing a Dhoti killing people ruthlessly. And you also think the person is Naruto."
"Parvati, I saw Brahmastra." Shiva interrupted Parvati mid-rant and Parvati's eyes also widened "Are you sure about that?"
"Yes dear, I am hundred percent sure!"
"Fine, but right now sleep and discuss it tomorrow."
"Ok dear but now sleep."
"Ok"
Parvati went to sleep hoping that the nightmare was just a nightmare and not a prophecy. Little did she know another creature had seen the same dream as her husband.
Mount Miyoboku, Elemental Nations
During the time Shiva had his nightmare, the elder toad sage also saw the same thing, and thus he called for Fukasaku and Shima.
"You called us geezer," Shima asked him. The reply was a light snoring from the said geezer.
"WAKE UP YOU OLD FART!" Shima screamed waking up the snoring toad.
"Huh? Fukasaku and Shima? Why are you here?"
"Geezer you called us."
"Oh yes, could you call Jiraiya-boy here?"
Iman's Mansion, Los Angeles, California, USA
After a long and grueling experience, Naruto was up in the shower to hide his puffy eyes after what he had learned or better yet seen from his sealed memories. His thought process was one of anger right now, 'Sarutobi, Shimura pray you do not come in front of me!' After showering, he changed and went downstairs to the resident couple to ask them about some good sights in Los Angeles. After noting them, he left the house and went to downtown LA, where he asked a stranger to direct him towards a pub or a bar in Los Angeles. After taking the direction, he approached the bar the native had guided him to. While going there Naruto was internally seething, thinking about what he saw in the memories, questioning what Tobirama-sensei said about his students, and thinking about how he would kill them, "You are lucky Sarutobi that you are dead but Shimura, I will personally make sure you don't ruin another life!"
His raging thoughts came to an end when he bumped into someone…
A Remote Part of Elemental Nations
"Baa-sama you are awake!" A young man in his 20s exclaimed and then, he heard the old woman in a daze mutter something.
"Baa-sama what are you saying?"
"… is alive!"
"Who is alive?"
"The heir! He is alive!"
Los Angeles, California
Naruto noticed the man bumped into, the person was fat, 6 foot, had a long beard, and had an 'A' tattoo on his hand [the Avengers (Marvel) logo]. "I am sorry did not see you." Naruto quickly apologized and started to move but someone gripped his hand.
"Aye man, what about the beer?" the guy asked him
"I am sorry, what?"
"What about the fucking beer you knocked out my hand right now?"
"Look man I told you I am sorry, I was not looking where I was going and knocked the beer out of your hand."
"I don't care dickhead, you fucking pay up."
"Okay fine." Naruto raised his hands. That's when the guy saw a 1965 Rolex Sea Dweller and then said, "Nuh uh, Mr. Pansyass, no bill, but the watch."
"Okay, look here I am willing to pay the money, but the watch is out of the question."
Then the guy took out a gun and pointed it at Naruto's head and said "Now listen here motherfucker you will not only give all the money you have but also the watch."
"Better yet let me give you a proposition, you remove the gun and I pay you 4 bucks for the beer and we all leave." Naruto said calmly
"Oh really or else what will happen, huh Mr. Pansyass" the guy said mockingly and Naruto sighed.
15 minutes later, LUX, LA
We see Naruto sitting at the bar of the so called place of sin and ordering a drink, where he is visited by a certain individual who started the conversation by saying,
"That was quite the show down there at the alleyway."
Naruto, a bit intoxicated, replied, "Hoh! I thought you would call the cops."
"Well I am not like other people, ah! Where are my manners? Myself, Lucifer Morningstar."
"A pleasure, Mr. Morningstar, the name's Naruto Uzumaki."
"Quite an exquisite name, Mr. Uzumaki."
"Same could be said for you, the king of hell." Naruto cheekily replied as the both men chuckled. Then they started conversing while drinking, after sometime Lucifer said, "Well as the devil, I do want to ask something?"
"Sure anything for you lord devil."
"Tell me Naruto, What do you desire?"
"Well… I want… to get hammered right now before getting sober."
"What an interesting man you are!"
"Same could be said for you lord Lucifer, tell me lord what do you desire?"
"Well I desire to have the cost of your drinks on my tab." With that both men started chuckling and drinking, and after half an hour he left the bar. "Quite the peculiar man you are Naruto Uzumaki to resist my charm like that." Lucifer said to himself.
Meanwhile at the alleyway near LUX
Two police officers were patrolling around the city when they drove around the alley near LUX and came upon the beaten men in that. She immediately switched on her transponder and said "This is detective Chloe Decker requesting for medical assistance and backup."
When enquired more about the situation she replied, "Ma'am Officer Daniel Espanoza and I were patrolling when we came upon these people who were in biker gang were beaten up and are in critical condition thus are in need of immediate medical attention."
While Chloe was communicating through her transponder, Daniel approached the assaulted people who backed away in fear.
"STAY AWAY!" One of the spooked gang members freaked out.
"Sir we are here to help you, please tell us what happened."
"That blond monster, he-he almost killed us"
From what the gang member said, that the blonde guy was some kind of a devil, not knowing that the said blonde was drinking with the devil.
West Bengal, India
In a dark room a telephone rang and a man picked it up.
"Hello"
"Ahoy mate!"
"Any good news?"
"Bruv that is the exact reason I was about to call you!"
"So?"
"Well the fireworks are about to go in fifteen minutes, so better get ready" As the caller said that he cut the phone and the receiver was grinning like there was no tomorrow.
20 Minutes Later in USA
Naruto's personal phone rang and he picked it up. As soon as he picked it up he heard someone hyperventilating.
"Hello?"
"Na-naruto?"
"Hey di! What happened? You are hyperventilating"
"It's about aunty" This sent alarm bells blaring in his head.
"What about Grandma?!"
"Dhriti- Dhriti was shot on her body ten minutes ago!"

"Dhriti was shot on her body "
West Bengal, India
There were heavy army guards in front of room 751 of the Old Digha Oghorkamini Hospital as the wife of one of their greatest late brigadier, who could have very well become a field marshal, the late Shankar Ghosh's wife, Dhriti Ghosh, was shot right under their noses. Thankfully due to her being a dextrocardiac person [a person whose heart is placed on the right side instead of the left side], she was saved as the bullet entered her chest and missed her heart by a centimetre. So for the Eastern command, this was a personal attack, as the said woman had fed them and had also saved them multiple times, sometimes by nursing them, other times by passing them crucial information that saved their lives. They often had to guard politicians out of duty, but this was for their family. For the younger generation, she was their grandmother, and for the older ones, she was their second mother. They made sure that they balanced their national duty and her security. All personnel on holiday were posted on her security and investigating the shootout. Along with her, her neighbors were also given security. Shrishti, who was in her school in Uttarakhand, was coming back with Naruto, who had booked an immediate flight to India and was coming to her.
Meanwhile in a dark room
"Hello mate wag warn"
"You Failed," the caller said in an eerie tone.
"Yeah I know"
"You could not kill both of them"
"Look man the plan was to shoot her so the brat comes immediately to Kolkata and I blow up the train coach she was on."
"So what went BLOODY WRONG?!"
"I DON'T KNOW maybe the fact that no one told me that the old hag had dextrocardia or that she had a grandson named Naruto or Ranvijay or whatever the fuck his name is!"
"Look this is the first time I got to know that she had dextrocardia but I did tell you about her grandson."
"You DID NOT tell me he was traveling with a fake passport."
"I did not know-"
"Do not worry what's done is done but I do have a plan."
"What?"
"Since the boy is here along with the girl, once they bring the old hag home from the hospital, I will blow the fucking house."
"What about the security?"
"Along with the security."
"Fine do what you will, but I want them FUCKING DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? FUCKING DEAD!"
"Copy that."
A Week Later
A taxi pulled up in front of the Old Digha Oghorkamini Hospital and stepped out a concerned Naruto and an equally concerned Shrishti. He ushered Shrishti to enquire about their grandmother's room number while he paid for the taxi. Once they got the room number, both concerned grandchildren moved from the third-floor corridor hand in hand, with Naruto leading the way toward their grandmother's room.
Once they reached the room number, they saw a whole army guard with Parvati and Abhijit being there. Once they saw both of them, they quickly ran towards them and Parvati hugged and comforted Shrishti about her grandmother's condition then asked about her well-being. At the same time, Naruto started enquiring with Abhijit about the current affairs regarding his grandmother.
"How is she?" asked Naruto
"Well she is out of danger right now, we would keep her here for 72 more hours for her safety, but you can see her right now. You want to?"
"No, let Shrishti go in first and then I will. Although why are there so many Army guards?"
That is when an army officer approached them, "Hello, I am Naruto" he greeted the officer.
"Myself Major Sukhdev Chandrashekhar, nice to meet you."
"Nice to meet you too, sir. Although I am very grateful, may I ask why such protection was given to her?"
"Young man, your grandmother is like a mother and a grandmother to our eastern command of the army, so it is given."
"Is it government-sanctioned?"
"Is she a politician or an IAS?"
"No."
"Then?"
"But is it fine with you guys, I mean like, you have your duty and then coming here to protect her, I cannot be enough thankful."
"Do not worry son, it is a debt we would repay with our life."
"Still sir, how are you managing this whole thing?"
"Well son, those who were on holiday have volunteered for the security detail while the other personnel do their duty and some other personnel do the investigation."
"Ok sir, but according to the army charter, your guys' vacation ends in three days."
"Yes, that is quite unfortunate, but we will manage."
"Thank you, sir, but it will not be required. I will do something about it. Although I would love it if you could share the investigation details."
"Sure my child but are you sure about the security detail?"
"Yes sir, you have done so much for the family, I will always be in your debt, and so if anything you require of this hon. Wing Commander please never hesitate."
The major chuckled and then said, "Sure son."
Naruto nodded, he then turned to Abhijit and said, "Abhijit da [an endearing term for big brother in Bengali] give me the diagnosis of dida."
"Are you sure you want to hear the diagnosis?" He asked hesitating but when he saw the look on Naruto's face he relented and then divulged.
"Two shots were fired on her. One on her left shoulder blade and another on her heart. Thankfully she had dextrocardia-"
"Dextrocardia?" Naruto interrupted.
"It is a rare heart condition where the heart instead of being on the left side of the body, is on the right side of the body so the bullet missed the heart by 3 inches. And in the shoulder blade, the bullet was lodged a good 2 inches deep. When she reached here she had lost a lot of blood and had stabilized the day before yesterday."
Naruto nodded and said, "OK, I will go and visit her."
"Fine," Abhijit said.
Once talking to him he went toward Dhriti's room and saw Shrishti was already there, so he waited. That is when he saw Parvati, and then she came running to him and they started conversing. At first, they began chatting about their well-being and then about Naruto's travels after which Naruto addressed the elephant in the room by asking Parvati, "What happened that day?"
Parvati sighed and said, "A week ago Dhriti and I, were thinking about having a feast, so we thought that we could go to the bazaar [market] and shop, and after shopping when we were returning, Dhriti invited me to her house and she was in the lawn when a person riding a bike shot her in the lawn. I am so sorry I could not do anything."
Naruto put his hand on her shoulder getting her attention as he shook his head, "You did the best you could, you are no god, you cannot magically heal her. Anyway did you see the person?"
"No. He wore a government school uniform and a helmet."
"Shit" He swore softly. Then they started conversing about other things when the door to the room opened as Shrishti came out. Parvati signaled Naruto to go in, Naruto nodded and went in.
Background Music [Papa Meri Jaan (whistle)]
As Naruto entered the hospital room his heart broke seeing the condition of his grandmother. The once jovial eyes of her now were dull and her face had also lost its shine. It was as if she had lost her will to live yet her face had no concern but acceptance about her fate.
He gingerly walked towards her bedside stool and sat there while noticing all the flowers and get well soon cards then he softly spoke,
"How are you feeling?"
Dhriti smiled softly and said "I am feeling good. Although…"
"Although?"
"I think my time has come."
"What?!" Naruto almost yelled shell shocked. "What the fuck are you saying?!"
"Language! Hospital or not I will still tan your hide young man" Dhriti said sternly. But this brought a smile to Naruto's face.
"You are getting released in three days." Naruto softly said.
Dhriti held his hand and said, "You know there is no need for that, my time is nearing."
"Again with this bullshit -"language!"- you are far too young to die."
Dhriti chuckled and said, "Naruto remember that there are four eternal things no one can run from birth, age, sickness, and death. I was born, am aging, had sickness and now the only thing left is death. So, I have accepted it."
"So, this is it huh? What about the boy you taught to live again huh? Or what about the little girl whose only relative is you?"
"Naruto …"
"Don't Naruto me. You don't get it. You taught me how to live. You gave me the best two years of my life without having any ulterior motives. All the people I have ever met in my life had an ulterior motive to get close to me but you, you never had one."
"Maybe that was my purpose."
"Huh?"
"Maybe my purpose of coming to this earth was to raise a capable child like you and to show you that sometimes being selfish is the best for someone. And now that I have raised such a person, my time has finally come."
"Then what about all those promises that you will be there for every great moment of mine and Shrishti's life? What about that promise?"
"Some promises cannot be fulfilled due to some reasons but enough of this topic, tell me how everything is."
"Well bad after talking to you."
Dhriti gave him a stare and said, "Naruto…"
"Fine, fine, it was good, I will be traveling to Punjab today and will be returning tomorrow."
"Punjab, why?"
"That is a secret."
She again held his hand and said, "You know, when I was shot, I felt lonely at that time and my greatest regret was that I could not see my grandchildren before passing away. But now that both of you are here my wish has been granted."
Before Naruto could reply a nurse knocked on the hospital door signaling the end of visiting hours. So Naruto quietly left the room contemplating what Dhriti had said.
End of Background Music
As soon as he came out he met and started discussing post-hospital recovery.
"Abhijit da, is there any requirement for a house nurse?"
"Not as such, since she only needs the medication for her low BP [Blood Pressure] and thankfully there were no fractures so no. But in case of any complications in the upcoming days, I will let you know."
"Ok thank you da" Naruto thanked him and then approached Major Sukhdev Chandrashekhar and asked him, "Major if it is alright, I would like to make a request."
"Sure son, go on."
"If it is possible, could you possibly arrange arms and ammunition for about 10 people?"
"May I ask why?"
"Well, Grandma said that she was happy that her grandchildren were with her. Then I am sure she won't mind her grandnephews being there with her."
The Major getting the message, said, "Sure I will arrange the weapons, you bring the boys."
Naruto smirked and said, "Roger that Major!"
After this, he met up with Parvati and Shrishti and instructed Shrishti to stay with Parvati for two days until he returned from Punjab and left the hospital for the airport.
Same Day Afternoon, Punjab, India
Background Music [Haiwaan (From Animal)]
[Conversation from here on out till Naruto leaves Punjab will be in Punjabi]
In the lush farms of Kartarpur, Punjab lived the Tabar family. Today was also an ordinary day for them, in the late morning, Gurpreet Singh Tabbar [Nickname: Gippi] was bench pressing on the terrace, and spotting him was his brother Harpreet Singh Tabbar [Nickname: Happy], when Happy saw three large SUVs coming towards their house and stopping before it's gate.
Gippi felt his brother stop spotting and also sat up to see who it was, along with, Gurnoor Singh Tabbar, who was on the terrace, also saw the SUVs and took a rifle in his hand to see who it was, and Manpreet who was changing his car's engine oil was surprised as to why there were SUVs in front of their house.
Out of the front SUV came Naruto who was driving it. He was dressed in a formal shirt and pants and had a cream-colored overcoat on with his dyed raven locks left untied with a blond beard and sunglasses on. He got out of the SUV breathing in the fresh air of the village.
Parvinder Kaur Tabbar, wife of Balbir Singh Tabbar who was combing her granddaughter's hair was staring at the young man with confusion evident on her face.
Naruto then started walking towards the premises when he looked up at the terrace to see Gippi and Happy staring at him with suspicion.
He removed his sunglasses, folded his hand towards the matriarch of the Tabbar family, and said,
"Grandma, you don't recognize me? I am the grandson of Dhriti."
A look of recognition came upon her face as she welcomed him to the house and he was escorted to the second-floor terrace.
Then a small kid came running to him and asked, "Is it true that you have two lexuses with you?"
Naruto amusedly hummed and lightly pinched the boy's chubby cheek while he continued, "My father has two tractors." He hummed in faux surprise while his mother, the wife of Gurnoor, lightly tapped his back and told the kid to go inside while handing a glass of water to Naruto.
"Thank you bhabhi [Sister-in-law]." She then proceeded to ask him,
"So are you married?"
"No bhabhi, not right now but surely in the future."
"Do call us at the wedding."
He smiled and replied, "Sure"
Then Parvinder interrupted and said, "Before getting married do show us the bride's photograph."
"For sure Grandma."
Naruto handed the glass back while looking at a person, who excitedly hugged him and asked,
"Paaji [an endearing term for brother in Punjabi, it can also be 'veerji' which also means the same], do recognize me?"
"Jetta [Nickname for Jitender]" he softly replied.
"Yes and do recognize the others, look there's Gippi and Happy and there is Gurnoor." Naruto nodded at that while Jetta said,
"Man, you have grown so big. So when did you arrive?"
"Just this morning"
Then Jetta holled, "Hey guys, K.P., Balli, look who's back!"
After some time, a Jeep pulled up with people in it, Balbinder Singh Tabbar [Balli] being the one driving it as he jumped out, he hollered,
"Why the hell were you calling me like a madman?! What happened?!"
While going inside he noticed the three SUVs parked there wondering what had happened.
End of Background Music
Then suddenly from inside the terrace an old man or better yet Balbir hollered, "Did you find who shot her?"
Naruto walked towards Balbir who was sitting with two other men.
"Sasriyakal [Greetings] Grandfather"
Balbir nodded acknowledging him, while Balbinder put a hand on Naruto's shoulder and asked, "Who are you?"
Jetta nudged and said, "Grandma Dhriti's grandson"
To which Balbinder replied, "Who's Dhriti?"
Jetta grabbed his arm and said "Grandma Dhriti"
Balbinder then said, "Dhriti Ghosh, but she was shot, what the hell are you doing here?"
Naruto replied, "I want help."
Balbinder then said, "THE Dhriti Ghosh now needs our help."
Balbir interrupted him and asked, "What help do you require from us?"
"Grandma has everything, resources, army personnel to back her up but the only thing she never had was time and courage, for that I am personally apologizing to Gramps but she is my grandmother. That thing is above all, whether the world survives or gets destroyed. Two bullets hit her, and no one knows when or where the next shot will be fired."
"Don't beat around the bush bruv" Balbinder said
"I want to request my Tabbars, to my brothers, I want your strength, your courage with me. I know this is an immediate and frankly absurd request, but only you people are the ones I can request this to."
Happy unfolds his hands and asks, "What is your plan going forward?"
Naruto looks at him and says, "Come with me to Bengal."
That is when Manjot enters the terrace, hugs Naruto, and says, "Paaji when did you come? You could have informed me beforehand. Man, I am so proud of you! Heard from a major of the Eastern command that my brother is not a group captain!"
After the brothers left the elders were discussing about the request.
"It has been years since the relationship was broken, and now just by listening to a damn story our boys will go after him?!" raged one of Balbir's sons.
Balbir calmly said, "When we were at rock bottom, it was his grandfather who helped us to where we are."
Then another of his sons said, "His father never tried to contact us, he could have rekindled the relationship. Right?!"
"You could have also rekindled the relation, son."
"But, father, our boys are going to fight a war, do you think we had the capacity?"
Meanwhile, Naruto was enjoying the homemade meal when one of Balbir's daughter-in-law said, "Son, this is our homemade food. I know you will like it."
"Taiji [Elder Aunt-in-law] this food is heaven"
Then Balbir's granddaughter-in-law said, "Don't worry about your brothers, they will surely go with you."
The story with the Tabbar brothers was a bit different,
Jasmeet, one of the younger ones raged, "Have you all lost your mind?! A monkey doesn't flip as quickly as you guys! Two little sweet he said and you flipped, do you have something to say?!"
To which Gurnoor calmly said, "I don't know about any of you, but I am going with him."
Jetta then spoke up, "I am also going with you." He then looked towards Jasmeet and said, " You moron, if he wants, he could have the army by his side but he was not here for that he was here to borrow his brothers' courage."
Jasmeet retorted, "Riiiight, after 20 damn years!"
"Jasmeet he is our brother, I don't know about you but I am going," Palveer said.
"I will give you a backhand. Go study for your college exams. I know he is new to this but the older one will understand." while looking at Manjot.
Happy then said, "Jasmeet there's no bigger thing than family."
Siddhu then jumped in, "What cause we are going for, our future generations will give our example that a brother stood up for his other brother."
Then Manjot joined in the conversation, "He brought the SUVs because he hopes that all of us will be going with him."
Jasmeet then softly said, "I wanted to hear this."
All his brothers were shocked at the sudden personality change, "What?!" some of them exclaimed.
"I was testing you guys, whether have we all rusted or not. Making a relation is like writing mud on mud with mud but upholding it is like writing water on water with water. And we all brothers will write water on water!"
They all laughed as they joined in a group hug.
In the evening, Naruto stood in front of the front lawn as the brothers got settled in the SUVs. He folded his hands to ask for their blessings in his endeavor and they reciprocated in kind by giving him their blessings as he settled in the SUV to go back to Digha.
Thus now what he did not know was that he got his greatest allies, his brothers. And together the Tabbar brothers reunited as a family ready to pounce at anyone like a hungry pack of wolves with Naruto like the alpha.
The Next Day, Digha, West Bengal
Once they reached Digha, Naruto called Parvati telling her about his guest and telling her to open their house, so that they could go inside. Once they reached, they offloaded their luggage and chose the one in which 3 people lived together. Parvati made lunch for all of them. During lunch, they met Shrishti, and it was a meeting of the ages, as Shrishti only knew Bengali and the broken English of a sixth grader. As hilarious as it was, Naruto felt pity for them so he became a translator. Then something more hilarious happened was that, 15 hulking men, who were there to protect and kill anyone were immediately melted by the cuteness of a sixth grader, and vowed to protect the said sixth grader. After sometimes it was decided that everyone would bunk, and Naruto would bunk with Shrishti while Manjot would sleep alone opposite Shrishti's room.
As the morning sun rose, after breakfast and morning workout, they started planning. Naruto for out that out of the fifteen of them, five of them were tech-savvy, and two of them had worked in the cyber security area, so it was decided that the five of them could do any form of hacking to gather information on their enemy. The rest waited for the major to arrive at their house, they did not have to wait for long as, at peak noon, an army vehicle arrived at their house, and Naruto knew that arms had arrived but was surprised when the major himself delivered it.
"Major" Naruto greeted him. That is when Manjot saluted the Major, "Major!"
"Major Manjot Singh Tabbar, it is an honor to finally meet you." Major Sukhdev Chandrashekhar said.
"Honor is all, mine. Sir." Manjot replied
"So, Naruto, they are all here?" Chandrashekhar asked.
"Yes sir."
"Good, now Naruto let me warn you, these weapons are not sanctioned by the government, we confiscated them from the enemy or terrorists but I will personally guarantee you that the weapons are in first-class shape."
"Sir, I do not care about the legality, only its functionality. Its working means it is fantastic for use."
"OK son"
With that, every one of the Tabbars took their weapons which ranged from CZ-100 to AK-101. As everyone took their weapons, Naruto was talking to Major Chandrashekhar,
"Sir, I have some more to request of you."
"Go ahead, my boy."
"Sir, 5 of my brothers are a bit more tech-savvy and thus can help me intelligence sir, I would like to take it from here and not give you any more troubles, you are a soldier, sir, you can't focus on just a single person."
Major chuckled at that and said, "Young man, there was never a doubt why you were made an Hon. Army personnel. Your Grandparents and parents would be immensely proud of you my boy."
"Thank you, sir."
"Do not fret about the intell. Collect it from me by the evening."
"Will do. Also, thank you very much, sir."
"It's my pleasure."
After the weapons deployment, the brothers went inside where Naruto addressed them, "Boys, happy with your weapons."
Balbinder smirked and said, "Bro, it's the best."
"Good, Shukhhi, Palveer, Gurkeerat, Man, and Ranjit, I want you guys to work around the clock to find anything about the killer. Once I get the information, I will give it to you. Find that motherfucker."
"Don't worry, we will find them, though we would need a computer," Palveer said
"My study room is all yours."
"Then consider your work done." Said Ranjit
"Thanks then enjoy your afternoon."
With that, Naruto left for his other side job [vigilantism] and returned for lunch, as the lunch was happening Parvati informed him that both of their LPG cylinders were finished, Naruto nodded in acknowledgment and mentally jotted it as another task to be done after he collected the information for the army. After a midday nap, he went out of the house, not knowing what his brothers were planning to do.
It took him three hours, but by 4 p.m. he reached his house with a dossier containing the crucial information along with the request for two gas cylinders. Since the delivery was in the morning, he requested his neighbors to receive it on his behalf. As he entered the house, he removed his overcoat and kept the dossier on the dining table, he smelled someone smoking and it came from his grandfather's study room, which was converted into a bedroom for the boys, so he went to check it out.
As he went inside, Happy was buttering a toast on a sofa while beside him was a white chick sleeping, while on the bed was Sangram doing a weird [childish, fifth grader] handshake with another white chick, while Manjot was sitting on a sofa massaging the foot of a white chick and another one sitting on adjacent sofa and smoking a cigarette. As Naruto entered, Happy loudly whispered, "Hey, Manjot." Warning him of Naruto entering, but it was too little too late. "What is happening? Who are these people?" Naruto asked in a shocked voice.
Manjot grinning like a loon looks at him, while Sangram covers his body with a sheet while Happy nudges the girl sleeping next to him to wake up. Then the girl next to Manjot says something in Uzbek, while Manjot says, "Housewarmers [For 18- people and idiots it means prostitutes]."
"You guys are married! Do even have an ounce of shame?!" Naruto scolds them while continuing, "K.P., you have a serious girlfriend right?!"
K.P. replies, "Paaji, I am not involved in any of this." Naruto then continues scolding, "Wife is away, so that means, you will do all this?!" while pointing fingers at the girls and their handler who was counting the money, and says, "Anyone of them can have a hidden camera on them, they can scan the house, do anything. Do you guys have basic threat perception or not?!" He claps his hands and says, "Come on, get them out." And then looks at the handler and rages, "Hey, get out motherfucker!"
Manjot trying to calm him down says, "Man how are you talking? Motherfucker, get out, get lost. They are our friends, they are our well-wishers. They would not come again."
"What do you think? We will call them here again?" Happy says to Manjot, while Naruto has a half-rage half-What the fuck face looking at the debauchery going on. The Sangram tries to calm him down and says, "Paaji, don't worry about the security, it's all normal. Everyone is personal."
"Whose all habits are these?" Naruto asks while Jetta who was near him answers, "Manjot, Happy, and Sangram."
To which he again questions, "So, why four are here?"
Jasmeet who was near him replies, "Manjot always requires two." Manjot had a come-on bro look on his face while looking at Jasmeet. Naruto then looks at Manjot and asks, "Do they know this at home?"
"Bro, who tells all these things at home," Manjot replies.
Jetta then says, "Bro, it won't happen again."
Naruto, fed up, says, "Don't fuck around guys, I know it is hard but come on! This was once grandfather's study room." And leaves the room.
"Come on man," Jetta says, while Manjot looking at the chick next to him says, "Sorry".
"Hey first you get lost," Jetta says while kicking out the handler as the prostitutes leave the room.
After some time, Naruto had finally calmed down from the fuckry his brothers had caused and called the cyber department to the living room so that they could finally have the intell and start working on finding the assaulter. As the brothers came inside the room, they were of the perception that Naruto was still pissed off thanks to their idiot brothers, so Gurkeerat took charge and said, "Bro, um, sorry about Manjot, Happy, and Sangram."
Naruto sighed and said, "It's ok, I know everybody has their bad habits and I am not condemning them for having them, but the problem is when the habits interfere with duty. Anyways, I want you guys to go through the files and find that fucker."
"Don't worry, we will find that fucker and his head will roll on your feet," Palveer said while taking the information file with him, while Naruto nodded as they left.
Next Day
As Dhriti was signing her release papers for Abhijit, Dhriti noticed Naruto walk in wearing a black shirt and pants and with a cream-colored overcoat and stood in front of her as from the sides all the fifteen Tabbar brothers came from either side of her chair and touch her feet and stood in a semi-circular arc with Naruto. She was in shock at what was happening and stood up and slowly made her way towards Naruto, who said to her, "Next time so much so someone scratches you, I will burn them." While Naruto was speaking Shrishti pointed at all of them and did the fantastic gesture [the hand gesture in which the last three fingers are up while the index and thumb make an 'O' shape].
Dhriti said with concern lacing her voice, "You did not have to do this much."
"Nothing is more important than your security."
Dhriti sighed in frustration and said, "Your silly little child. Come here," and drew him in a hug which he happily reciprocated.
After which, all of them sat in the cars and while returning to her house, she said, "Naruto, could you do me a favor?"
"Anything within my power."
"Do my lawyer and tell him to meet me today."
"Ok, that will be done."
Once everyone reached the house, Dhriti was surprised to see no one standing there. Generally, if something big happens in the locality, especially if someone gets shot, there will be a crowd in front of their house asking about their well-being, health, etc. but there was no one, as if reading her mind, she heard Naruto say, "I told the locality that you needed some privacy and security after the incident, thankfully they were understanding."
In front of the house, they met with their neighbors, as the ladies embraced each other and the younger one fussed over the older one, Shivansh went towards Naruto and said, "By the way Naruto, the gas guy came and fixed the gas in your house and also gave an additional cylinder." He nodded in acknowledgment before both of them were forcefully inserted into the ladies' conversations. As they entered the house, Parvati forced Dhriti to sit as she declared that she would cook for all of them, with that she sent Shivansh, Naruto, Sangram, and Gippi to the market to buy ingredients for the feast. The boys left, and Manjot approached Dhriti,
"Sasriakal Beeji [Greetings Grandmother], how are you feeling right now?"
"A lot better than the week before. So let me guess when that idiot said that he was going to Punjab, he meant that he was getting all of you."
"Yes, but don't fault him, when we heard about the shooting we were worried about you."
"How did you hear about that?"
"Well, I was once in the eastern command right?"
Dhriti chuckled and said, "You cheeky brat!" then she sighed and bullied through her insecurities and asked the question that plagued her mind, "How are everyone back in pind ['pind' meaning village in Punjabi]."
"They are well. Gramps still wishes you could come to visit us."
"I know, but sometimes I just can't, so many memories, so much love yet so much pain. Your uncle offered me to come to Bombay with him when they shifted away, though it was more like your aunt who gave me the proposal, but I could not for me this was my life. Then after your great-grandfather's death, going to pind became too much painful for me. Balbir tried but you cannot help someone who does not want to be helped. Anyways, enough about me, about the guns I saw. I know that air security would not allow guns and the same about the railways. So how did you get the guns?"
Manjot gulped knowing that he would get grilled he threw Naruto under the bus by saying, "Well Naruto arranged the guns with the help of Major Sukhdev Chandrasekhar. Most of them are a bit illegal."
"A bit illegal?"
"Mostly confiscated from terrorists."
"You boys are going to be the death of me."
"Hehehe, sorry grandma."
"It is good to see you all here."
"Us too grandma, us too."
As the talk came to an end with Manjot informing him about his wife and others introducing themselves and chatting, the four men who went out came back with a variety of vegetables and spices. As they put the groceries on the table, Naruto insisted on helping out Parvati in the kitchen, while Shrishti was clinging to her grandmother and Dhriti accepted it, knowing about how her granddaughter lost her parents and then almost lost her also. The afternoon feast was a blast for the group as the brothers could not stop singing praises of both Naruto and Parvati. As the evening came around, the family lawyer Arjun Roy visited them. He was a bit shocked at the amount of security but was escorted inside the house.
Inside the house, he and Dhriti went into her study room where they were discussing something, while Naruto was in his room resting after the day's work, that is when Jetta knocked on his room door, "Paaji, grandma is calling you to her study room."
"Did she tell you why?"
"No" Naruto nodded and left towards the study room. As he reached the room, he knocked on the door and entered the room. Dhriti ushered him in by saying, "Naruto, come in. I think you have met my lawyer Arjun Roy."
Naruto nodded and shook the said man's hand, "Nice to meet you again."
"You too."
"So, why have you called me here?"
"Naruto, I need you to sign some documents."
"Sure." With that, the lawyer pointed to the space and Naruto signed it. Once done it was evening, so Dhriti insisted him to stay for dinner. And after dinner, everyone went to sleep.
Next Day
In a remote building,
A person rang the telephone,
"Yello Mate!"
"You sound a lot jolly for a person whose targets are under high-end security."
"Oh! That. That's not a problem anymore. Today she dies along with the brat and one or two collateral damages."
"Oh! Really! Pray tell how?"
"That would be telling, but should I tell you my plan?"
"You should because I paid you."
"Humph spoilsport! Anyway, I have created 6 fake signals, and knowing your little soldier problem would rush in like a mad bull. I am anticipating about nine to twelve and at best fifteen of the security boys to go after the signal, then I will kill them."
"You told me how you will drive away the security, what about the murder?"
"You see your little soldier had submitted a request for LPG gas cylinders, now instead of the guys at the office taking it I took it, and delivered the two cylinders but one of them had a time bomb. So TIK TIK BOOM!"
"Heh, there was a reason I paid you. But what about the little soldier, how are you going to kill him."
"Mate, you did not give me money for killing him. Money equals Murder."
"You greedy bitch!" With that, he cut the phone.
Ghosh House
Naruto woke up to the sound of breaking glass. He woke with a jolt, thinking someone had broken into the house. As he ran downstairs, he saw not only him but some of the brothers were awake as well. When they reached downstairs, they saw a black cat had pushed one of the spice jars. It irritated them but they started their morning early as their sleep was already destroyed. The rest of the morning was pretty mundane for them, after breakfast the tech team went to work to find any ounce of a clue for it was futile as they could not find anything.
Shrishti woke up that morning with a cold sweat and a sense of dread filling her as she had a nightmare of getting burnt alive. Dhriti on the other hand a weird dream of talking to her father and her husband. As both of the ladies woke up, the breakfast was being prepared. So not thinking anything both of them got freshened up and sat for breakfast. After that they had a slow morning which turned into the afternoon, doing mundane jobs and chatting with the neighbors.
The lunch was a rowdy affair as usual but Naruto, Dhriti, and Shrishti along with some of the Tabbar brothers had an underlying sense of dread filling their hearts. After the late lunch at 2 p.m., the tech department shockingly made a breakthrough, they had hacked some CCTV cameras in the state and had tapped some calls and had a possibility of finding the criminal jotted down to six places, two in Shankarpur, two in Padima and two in Talgachhari.
As soon as Naruto heard the news of finding the criminals, he immediately called for a meeting with the brothers.
"So, bro what happened?" Manjot asks.
"Palveer, tell them." Naruto tells them. Then Palveer shares the intell with them.
"Are we one hundred percent sure about this?" Sangram asks.
"I don't know, but it is worth a shot." Naruto replies and then continues, "Also the areas are fifteen to twenty minutes away from here."
"So we go in blind?" Ranjit asks.
"Yes"
"So, how are we doing it?" Gippi asks.
"We will go in pairs of two and four of us will stay here while the rest twelve of us will go. One techie will go with one non-techie. You can make your pairs."
With that, it was decided that Gurkeerat and Balbinder would be a pair investigating one place in Shankarpur while the other would be done by Naruto and Manjot. Sangram and Man will go to Padima along with Ranjit and Jetta while the two pairs that will go to Talgachhari will be Palveer and Happy and Sukhhi and Gippi. While K.P., Siddhu, Harpreet, and Jasmeet will guard the house. As this was decided they all left with the blessing of Dhriti.
Meanwhile
A Caucasian man with raven hair, a light beard, and 6 ft. tall was going through the locality when he saw the Tabbar brothers pass by him. He smirked and called someone.
"Hello, mate." He said.
"Hello"
"Well, your little problem soldier just went out."
"So what?"
He sighed and said, "Well in 10 minutes your target is dead forever."
"Hehahaha, Good! Very Good!"
Back with the Tabbars
As Naruto and Manjot went in Shankarpur and then wildly started searching for the killer not knowing that they passed him. As they found the building, they wildly searched for the shooter and came with nothing. As he was raging in frustration, his phone rang he saw Balbinder calling him and telling him they found nothing. Not only Balbinder but Jetta, Happy, Sukhhi, and Sangram called him also telling him that they found nothing. He sighed as if it was for nothing, and then he told each of the team to meet them at the Digha bus stand.
Once they met at the Digha bus stand, all of them shared their experiences, as all of them found out it was just a hoax. Dejected, they all were returning home which was a seven-minute walk from there, as they were walking towards their house, they saw smoke coming from that direction, so they increased their pace and as they reached a bit closer, they could see a part of their house burning so, the brothers made a run for it, pushing the police and the blockade out of the way.
As he reached the front lawn, they saw Shivansh was still there, "Oh, thank god, you boys are here."
The only thing Naruto could say was, "How?-What?-When?-Where?"
"There was a blast 20 minutes ago, both Dhriti and Shrishti were injured along with one of your brothers, the rest three are ok, they escorted them to the hospital."
Without saying anything else, he and the others packed themselves into the other SUVs and left for the hospital.
Old Digha Oghorkamini Hospital
Abhijit Katta, a doctor by profession was sometimes not recognized as an Indian due to his looks. He looked like a Caucasian man with curly hair and a dense beard [Due to 'spoiler' reasons his look reference will not be disclosed], sometimes he felt a bit weird when the people from his locality would come and talk to him in broken English and would be surprised when he spoke in fluent Bengali, but then 3 years ago, his brother in all but blood, Naruto Uzumaki had appeared and faced the same problem, why? Due to his blonde hair, they pretty much bonded over this and other things.
And now the same brother in all but blood was rushing towards him like a mad bull, looking distraught. He grabbed him and tried to calm him down, but before he could say anything, Naruto questioned him "Where are they?"
Now, in his work, the worst part was to face the relative of the patient but it is what it is. So he bullied through and spoke, "All three are admitted, Shrishti miraculously had only first-degree burn, so was not a problem same for Sardar Ji but he had a bit of second-degree burns too, not that it is life-threatening…."
When Abhijit did not speak further Naruto egged him, "What about grandma?" Again Abhijit did not respond. "Abhijit, what about grandma?"
Finally, he replied, "I am sorry…"
These three words broke him from inside, but he listened to the diagnosis, "She was impacted the most by the blast, there were numerous third burns to her body. It was too late by the time she came here. We tried our level best, but could not do so much." When his eyes met with Naruto's, he saw a man broken by grief. Then he softly said, "She has about 20 to 25 minutes left, you can say your last words to her."
That is when the comforting hand of Jetta fell on his shoulder, as he looked towards him, Jetta nodded softly. Naruto inhaled and then said to Jetta, "You guys go and pay your respects to her, and I will go after you guys." Before anyone could he went towards the balcony of the hospital. As he reached the balcony he leaned towards the balcony and lit a cigarette then he took a few puffs of it before holding the rails with both his hands and lightly sobbing, the only indication being his shoulder shaking.
This was a new kind of grief for Naruto to experience. Sure this was not the first instance of death that he faced. Sandaime was one, but this one hit hard for him. Unlike Sandaime who used to visit Naruto once a month, give him his monthly allowance and Naruto visited him in his office, Dhriti was a real family member to him, she was there during his lowest of lows, and she showed him real kindness, without any ulterior motive, supported him through all his endeavors, and most important of them of all, she loved and cared for him like a family member and that kind of love had moved him.
A part of him was still thinking of this like a sick prank and at any moment she would spring up to life and hug him. He wanted to punch Abhijit in the face when he told him the diagnosis, but the rational part of him was commanding him to accept the dark reality.
That is when, his thoughts were interrupted by a hand on his shoulder, when he looked it was of Manjot, indicating that they had paid their respects and only he was left. As he was going we met K.P., Siddhu, Harpreet, and Jasmeet, all looking ashamed and defeated. He saw K.P. with heavy bandages on. Before anyone out of the four of them could say anything, Naruto softly spoke, "It's OK. None of you should blame yourself. None of us could tell that there would be a gas leakage, so it's ok, you should go and rest." That said, he went towards her room to see her for the last time. In the hallway, he met Shrishti, whom he drew in a tight hug and kissed her head, after some time he let go of her and opened the door to her room.
Once he opened it, his heart broke into pieces. Looking at her, his throat closed. He forcefully blocked his tears so he could speak. He slowly walked towards her sat on the stool beside her and spoke,
"You know I hate you a lot" he started with sadness oozing from his voice and continued, "You old people are the biggest hypocrites, you said never to break any promises, but what about you, you old bag why are you not speaking." He gripped her hand while laying his head down on her belly and said, "You taught me to live, taught me that there is life other than surviving and fighting, and now you are dying yourself, I HATE YOU, you old hag." He raised his head and looked at her, "You promised me that you would be there at our weddings and be there for me at any and every step of my life but you broke that promise but I am not like you." He found a scalpel near the bed, took it, sliced the face of his thumb, and said, "I, Naruto Uzumaki take the oath of blood that I will protect Shrishti till I die and that is a promise no matter what I will fulfill even if I have to flow a sea of blood, you hear me you old hag, I promise that." After that emotional high, he deep breathed and said, "Even if you were not my real grandma, I still love you like one, I love you, Grandma."
As if she was waiting to hear that, after he said that, her heart monitor graph showed a flat line, indicating she passed away. Naruto closed his eyes and went outside. As he emerged from the room, the adults saw his body language and understood. Parvati hugged Shrishti closely to her and her damn burst while others put their head down in respect of her. Abhijit came and put a supporting hand on his shoulder. Naruto turned to see him and then said to him in a soft, almost non-hearable voice, "When can we bring her home for the last rites?"
"There are just some formalities you have to do. Just some signatures and she could be transported home by the night."
"Alright." With that, he went to Shivansh and said, "Can you guys bring Shrishti home? I will have to contact the cemetery for her cremation."
Shivansh gave him an understanding nod and ushered Shrishti and Parvati to come with him, while Naruto ushered the brothers to go with him. Once done with booking the cremation, they stopped at a restaurant and ate after which, he told them to go to the house, pick up Shrishti and the neighbors for the last rites, and go to the local cemetery. In contrast, he went to the hospital and after some formalities, he took her directly to the cemetery. He steeled his nerve for the cemetery as they reached there. They saw the brothers present there and the last rites commenced, it was an hour-long rite after which her ashes were collected and given to him in a container.
Once home none of them could sleep for different reasons. The Tabbars could not sleep out of the shame of failing their brother and not protecting their grandmother. The neighbors out of the death of someone close to them, while the grandchildren had other reasons altogether.
Naruto lying on the bed could not sleep a wink, when he tried, his eyelids could not shut. So, he got up from the bed and started wandering around the house when he walked into Dhriti's study room, once walking in, he started reminiscing about the good old days, and spending time with her. She struggles with teaching him, joking with him, supporting him during his bout of vigilantism, also comforting him during his first kill, and celebrating her and his birthdays. It brought tears to his eyes as he sat on his chair. When he looked at her desk, his attention was drawn towards a certain envelope. The envelope was regarded towards him and Shrishti, so he chose to open it. There were two letters in the envelope, one towards him and another towards Shrishti. He opened the letter directed towards him,
________________________________________
Dear Naruto,
If you are reading this, then either you have broken into my study room and read it or I am dead. If it's the former, then boy get your ass out of the room before I spank your ass. If it's the latter then read further. I know you are very cross with me but as I told you, there are four things a person cannot run from, birth, aging, sickness, and death. When I was in the hospital, I knew my time was up. I knew I had completed my life's mission. What mission you may ask? It was to guide a terrified child to become a lion. Before I met you, there was a part of me that always felt incomplete, as if someone was telling me to do something, the was a bear in me trying to get out. When I met you, I did not see a dangerous rogue ninja, I saw a terrified little child, whose reality was shattered, who was afraid to trust. After I met you I found my life's calling, first Abhijit, then you. Maybe my life's mission was to help people like you, who have lost their way to guide them. When the first bullet hit me, I could hear you shouting at me to watch out "Dida watch out!" by the second bullet, I realized, I was alone. When you came back, I was so happy that I would not die alone. I know that the bullets won't be the only assassination attempt, if I die an unnatural death, don't go taking revenge. No one is a saint in this world, the world can never be black and white, it is always grey. I am getting karma for what I have done. And I have done things, I will never forgive myself, so do not go flowing other's blood. When I met you, I knew you were special, you were a grandson, I will never deserve. If I die, do me a favor, or rather two favors. First be there for Shrishti, no matter what. And secondly, call Arjun so he could deliver my will.
Your Loving Grandmother
Dhriti Ghosh
________________________________________
Naruto was silently sobbing after reading the letter, regretting his action of not spending the last moments of her life. He sobered up after some minutes of sobbing and went towards the kitchen to drink water and eat a midnight snack, after which he went towards his room that is when he heard someone go up the stairs, when he checked he saw it was Shrishti going up towards the terrace. When he saw her, he made a decision. He went towards Dhriti's study room and took the letter tailored towards Shrishti. He went up towards the terrace and saw Shrishti sitting, facing towards the railing.
Sometimes silence speaks the loudest. He quietly went on the roof and sat beside her, and then he slowly slid the letter on her lap. As she read the letter she started bawling, and the only thing Naruto did was hug her tightly. She cried herself to sleep and Naruto carried her to her room and tucked her in.
Next Day
As the morning came, the news spread like wildfire in the locality and everybody came to their house to pay their respects. Not only the locality but also the extended family in the pind, called him and asked about what happened and gave their condolences and then Naruto gave the phone to Manjot so he could talk. While all this was happening, Major Chandrashekhar visited.
"How are you feeling?" The Major asks.
"Numb, but thank you for asking. And thank you for coming."
"No problem. She was a great person."
"She was." Naruto then inhaled and said, "Well since we don't need the arms anymore you can take them."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Yeah, she dead, so there is no need for no weapons."
"Ok."
With that, he went inside the house and took out all the weapons that were given to them. And then handed to the Major, "Here, these are the entire weapon, check them."
"OK, yeah it is the entirety."
"OK, thank you."
"No problem, but do call me if anything happens."
"For sure." With that, he left the house and Naruto then called the lawyer. "Hello," Arjun answered.
"Hello, this is Naruto."
"Hello Naruto"
"Hey, I called to tell you, that Grandma passed away yesterday night."
"Oh, my condolences."
"So, Grandma instructed me to call you after her death, and said about some will."
"Oh, that! OK, no problem. I will be at your house in thirty minutes."
"Ok thank you."
After half an hour, Arjun arrived at the Ghosh house. He went in and met Naruto and both of them went inside Dhriti's study room. After getting seated, Arjun started talking, "Sorry for your loss." Naruto nodded and then Arjun continued, "Well, Dhriti predicted her death in near times. So, she modified her will."
"What will?"
"Well, she had made a will about dividing her money and property between you and Shrishti. Since Shrishti is still a minor, you were the only person she could depend on for the legal work."
"Ok, so, how much are we talking?"
"Well, she made you the official guardian of Shrishti, so all her share will be under your care until she becomes a major." Naruto nodded and then said, "So what split are we talking about?"
"It is a 50-50 split."
"How much is a share worth?"
"Well, both of your shares are worth rupees 10 Crores [100 million] each."
Naruto's eyes bugged in disbelief, "You fucking with me?"
"No, I am not. She was a great businesswoman. She has some real estate here in India and some in the foreign, investments in companies, and her total assets worth up to 21 Crores [210 million] rupees."
Naruto was shocked still. He did not know, how much she was worth and she was that rich. Now, he realized how she could afford five passports and tried to sponsor his trip. After some time he said, "Motherfucker, so how will the asset be divided."
"Well, as you have visited the foreign countries, you get the foreign real estate, some in Turkey, some in England, some in the US, and some in France." Naruto nodded, and then he said, "Ok fine, so do I have to sign on some shit or something."
"Well, you did two times."
"Oh, so that was, that for."
"Yes."
"Oh ok thank you, sir."
"No problem." With that, he stood up and said, "Well I will take my leave now."
Naruto also stood up and said, "Yes, let me escort you out."
As the lawyer was leaving something was brewing between the Tabbar brothers after he entered the house and that is when Manjot approached him with something important.
Flashback, to the morning
Manjot could not sleep last night as the death of Dhriti struck him. This was the first time that he lost someone personal under his protection. It burned him. The moment he closed his eyes, all his dead comrades called him FAILURE in a creepy voice. He could not sleep at night so he roamed in the house, and he saw Naruto sobbing in Dhriti's study room, this made his self-hate grow further. This caused him to think about the blast and his suspicions grew. The blast exactly happened after all of them left, exactly 10 minutes later. It was too suspicious for him. Then he remembered that the gas was changed just 3 days ago, when he overheard Naruto talking with Parvati so he thought that he would go to bed and ask Parvati tomorrow.
When Naruto was talking with people, Manjot asked Parvati when the gas was changed and his guess was correct. So he went towards, one of his brothers, a brother who was hungry for revenge, Palveer. So he approached Palveer and explained his plan. He was onboard and after their investigation, what they found made their blood boil. So he approached Naruto as he came back from escorting the lawyer.
Flashback End
"Hey, bro got a second?" Manjot asks him.
"Yeah, sure what's up?" Naruto replied.
"You might wanna come with me, I found something, you might wanna see."
Naruto nodded and then both of them went into Palveer's room where once the three of them were inside the room Manjot said, "Palveer, tell him."
Naruto looked towards him as he said, "Well bro, I know this might sound offensive to you, but do not interrupt me while I will be telling you what I found out" Naruto nodded, "Well…There is no sugarcoating… Grandma was murdered." As he looked at Naruto's face, it was a cold face with his eyes telling him to go on, "You can see on the screen there are three pictures, one during her shooting, another as the guy came to change the gas, and the last one was after we left for the ghost search."
Naruto nodded and Palveer continued, "They once zoomed in, we can see he had an 'A' tattoo on his hand, so either this guy is a gang, which is highly impossible or he is a cold-blooded assassin, which is likely true. It took some time to render but this might be the tattoo." He handed Naruto a picture. All Manjot saw in Naruto was a cold emotionless face.
Naruto then spoke in a soft voice, "You guys, let's go have dinner, tomorrow, at the terrace where we meet up." With that, all of them went for dinner.
Same Day Midnight
Naruto was sitting on the porch shirtless, only with his white pajamas on. One hand holds the tattoo picture, an old monk is in the other hand, and a cigarette is on the fingers of the same hand. His long hair was all messed up reminiscing the past.
Short Flashback: Three Years Ago – Valley of the end
Sasuke said to him, "You cannot understand me!"
Short Flashback End
Naruto then started talking to himself, "Hehe, I hate to say it but that cunt was right about that. Sorry, Grandma, but blood will flow. I did tell you, if anybody so much so put a scratch on you, I will burn them." As he was speaking that, he again looked at the tattoo and burned it. He knew that tattoo very well as it was of that gang he beat up during his stay in L.A. The only thing in his mind after he took a puff of his cigarette and then a swig of his old monk is revenge and his eyes turned red thinking about it.
Meanwhile in Elemental Nations – Konohagakure
In the hokage office, Tsunade and her unofficial advisor Jiraiya were chatting, Tsunade said, "Jiraiya, 3 years have passed"
"I know"
"Do you think-"
"He is alive Tsunade, I know, he is alive."

Elemental Nations
In the Hokage's Office, Tsunade and her four advisors and Jiraiya discussed what they discussed 3 years ago. "So how do you think they will take it?" Tsunade asked them.
"Knowing the brat's reputation of being friends with them, I will say they will be shocked," Jiraiya replied.
"Indeed. As naïve as the jinchuuriki was, he was a good encourager, and had sense's will of fire." Danzo added. This threw all of them off. Danzo praising someone, was like saying, that Orochimaru was the most loyal ninja of all time. Not just Jiraiya and Tsunade were shocked but Homura and Koharu too. They had never heard their teammate praising someone, the only times he praised someone were Hiruzen and Tobirama sensei.
Tsunade cleared her throat "Ahem. So, how will we approach breaking the news to them?"
"Hime, be straightforward, do not beat around the bush. The team captains already know, so, they can cushion the blow." Danzo advised and Jiraiya agreed with him and advised, "Yes, Tsu-hime, from what I know of those brats, the Nara could deduce things easily like his father, so if we beat around the bush, he might find out more than we would want. Also let's give them some hint about him being a jinchuuriki, and keep his parentage out of it."
All the advisors nodded and Tsunade said, "Ok, let's lead with that."
After some time Shizune came in and said "Milady they are here." And then Koharu said, "Hime, we will take our leave now." And the advisors left.
After that the Rookie Nine or now Rookie Seven and Team 9 consisting of Rock Lee, Neji Hyuuga, and Tenten, and their sensei Might Gai. As they entered they saw Jiraiya was there and they knew that Naruto was gone with him. So, they thought Naruto was back too. Hinata and Sakura visibly brightened due to different reasons. Jiraiya gauged their reactions and felt pity for them. Although he could see that the Sensei's already knew why they were there. Kurenai Yuuhi or now Kurenai Sarutobi after getting married to Asuma Sarutobi and giving birth to their son Hiruzen Sarutobi named after the kid's late grandfather was preparing herself to support the meek and shy Hinata Hyuuga. Kakashi was looking visibly depressed while putting on a stoic visage, so when Tsunade would speak of their blunder, he could take it on the chin and own up to it.
Tsunade took a deep breath knowing it would be difficult to tell these kids but they were their best options, though she did feel bad for Hinata, she was a gentle soul, a type that should never be a shinobi. Though she thought it was for the greater good, the news might toughen up the girl. When she heard the said girl had a huge crush on her grandson, she was naturally curious. After she learns about the reasoning and her stalking him, she wants them not to get together because even though Hinata might be a good girl. But for someone like Naruto you needed a mentally stronger and more confident person to be with him, Naruto needed someone like his own mother. Someone who would support would unconditionally, yet put you down, if you said something stupid and she could not see those qualities in Hinata.
Tsunade started speaking, "Before telling you this information and this is a SS rank information so any leakage could result in straight execution without trial, I would like to say that I do not want to be interrupted, is that clear?"
Everyone except Jiraiya chorused, "Yes ma'am."
Tsunade nodded and continued, "Three years ago, Jonin Shikamaru Nara, then Chuunin, was given a mission the retrieval of now rouge Sasuke Uchiha." This gained visible reactions from Chouji Akimichi, Rock Lee, and Kiba Inuzuka while Shikamaru Nara and Neji Hyuuga were clenching their teeth and fists. Tsunade continued, "It was a failed mission, with Chuunin Inuzuka and Jonin Nara receiving minor injuries while the others received major injuries and were hospitalized, during that hospitalization Genin Uzumaki" Hearing Naruto's name the rookies and team 9 perked up "blew up his hospital room, stole 200k from the bank and abandoned the village." She let the information set in. She then gauged their reaction, the common one was disbelief and shock, Kiba, Lee, and Sakura wanted to protest but one eye from Tsunade, they kept quiet and Tsunade nodded and continued, "Genin Naruto Uzumaki had officially become a rouge three years ago, your sensei's were teamed up with Jiraiya to retrieve him. It failed. This is where you come in, if you ever cross paths with him, I want you to convince him to return, with force if required. But in no condition at all should he be maimed or be killed. Am I clear?"
The only thing they could do was nod. Tsunade then said, "Good, you are dismissed!" With that everyone left, while Shikamaru stayed back. Tsunade saw him and said, "Shikamaru do you want to say something?"
"I wanted to ask you something?"
"Go ahead"
"Well when we were going after Sasuke, you never gave any constraints, so why now? What's so special about Naruto that even 'the last Uchiha' was not spared this much?"
"Leave it to a Nara to deduce shit." Tsunade thought and then looked at Jiraiya as he nodded towards her.
Tsunade sighed, "This is a S rank information I am sharing with you. 16 years ago, when the Kyuubi attacked the village, Minato never defeated the beast."
"What?"
"Yes, tailed beasts like Kyuubi can never be properly defeated, they could only be sealed in people. The person in this case was…"
"Naruto."
"Yes"
"This makes sense. So this is why he was ostracized. I had my suspicions. It was odd that people ostracized him based on his pranks. Sure some of them were annoying but to discriminate against him that much. Now it makes more sense."
"So what will you do with this information?"
"Nothing." Tsunade nodded and then Shikamaru left.
West Bengal, India
A lot of people say there are five stages of grief. Denial, something he felt when he first time heard about her death, then it changed to the second stage, Anger. After which he was in the third stage, Bargaining, where he thought, he should have taken the bullet and should have been there during the blast. It made him Depressed, which was the fourth stage of grief. But then the cold hard reality of her death came crashing down thus he had to accept it, which was the fifth stage. But what people do not know is that there is a sixth stage, Revenge.
It was a magma brewing in his soul, so much so, that he skipped his breakfast to plan his revenge. After some time the Tabbar brothers came up to the terrace. When they came up, they saw Naruto smoking. Palveer took charge and called him, "Bro, everyone is here, you wanna address them?"
Naruto turned around and saw all of them and nodded then he said, "Alright, First, I wanted to say thank you, for helping me." Everyone nodded and then Naruto continued, "First I want to ask, out of all of you, who are going to college?"
Jasmeet, Siddu, Harpeet, Sukhhi, and Gurkeerat raised their hands. Naruto noticed them and then said, "Gurkeerat, get yourselves tickets for Punjab, they are leaving tomorrow." Before anyone could object, Naruto raised his hand stopping the resistance in its tracks, and said, "I know what you will say, but your education is important and the work we are to do is going to get us in jail, so do not object." All they could do was nod with their head down, Naruto saw that and sighed and said, "I not undermining you guys but I promised your family to keep you safe, so you are going to Punjab as you all have a lot of life options for you and I will to jeopardize it with a criminal record." With that, he handed some money to Gurkeerat, and the five brothers left while the rest of them who were left were being addressed by Naruto, "Palveer, tell them what you told me yesterday."
Palveer nodded and proceeded to tell them the intell he found yesterday, and the reaction was an expected one, revenge, their blood was boiling for it. Naruto saw their faces and smirked, then he addressed them, "Got your blood boiling right, got mine too. When I saw the bloody tattoo, I recognized it." This grabbed everyone's attention as spoke again, "During my stay in America, I was confronted by a gang who had that same tattoo, you know what that means right?"
"That means a lot of blood is about to flow," Ranjit replied to his question.
"So when do we leave for the US?" Balbinder asked him
"The day after tomorrow, I still have to manage the visas," Naruto replied.
"Leave the visas to me, I will hack their servers to get us visas," Man told them. Naruto smirked and then said, "So, it is decided, we all will leave the day after tomorrow, after we send the boys home and wrap this shit up before the 13th day." Everyone nodded in satisfaction and exited the terrace.
Later that day, Shrishti came barging into his room. Naruto saw her having a mixed face, a face having anger, concern, and sadness. As he understood her face, he got what she would tell him. Naruto asked her, "What happed Shrishti? Is there something you want to say?"
"Yes." Naruto gave her the green light. Shrishti spoke immediately, "I heard what you were planning."
"Yes?"
"Why?"
"Why what?"
"Why are you going to your death?" Shrishti screamed at him, while he calmly counter questioned, "Who told you I am going to walk my grave?"
"Then what about your revenge run, do you think I would not know?" She raged
"And how does this relate to my death?" Before she could answer he spoke again, "Is it related to grandma's death."
Shrishti visibly flinched when he said that. Naruto stood and tightly hugged Shrishti and she sobbed into him and he lightly kissed on kissed on her head. Then they separated and he clasped the necklace Tsunade gave him and then clasped it to Shrishti's neck when she saw it, Naruto spoke, "This necklace was given to me by my grandma as a sign of good luck. I am giving this to you. I promise this Shrishti, I will never leave you, I will always take care of you, so I will survive and come back to you, my dear sister."
After Naruto said that Shrishti bawled into him and continued to cry for a good ten minutes after which she rapidly hit his chest and said, "You better come back to me."
"Without any doubt. Now young lady let's go have lunch all right?" She nodded and then they went to have lunch with the brothers.
The next morning, the five brothers, Jasmeet, Siddu, Harpeet, Sukhhi, and Gurkeerat had packed up and the brothers escorted them to the railway station to send them home. And then the rest of the guys went home to rest. Man went into cracking visas for the brothers, while Naruto went to his neighbors to take care of Shrishti for a while, where he made the excuse that he was going to pind for a while on so business.
Then during the afternoon, the brothers were chilling when Man came to the terrace and said, "Guys pack up, we going to America."
Naruto shocked said, "You fucker, you did it! You hacked them."
"Heh yeah, we got 2 B-1 visas, 6 B-2 visas, and 3 M-1 visas."
"Huh?" Gippi said.
"You dumbass we got 2 business visas, 6 tourist visas and 3 student visas, now choose who will get what." After some discussions it was decided, that Naruto and Ranjit would have the business visas while K.P., Sangram, and Happy would have the Student Visas and the rest would have the tourist visas. With their passports ready, it was decided that they would go in three waves first was during late night and then the next morning and the evening. Naruto decided to in the third wave, after hugging Shrishti tightly along with the other two for the USA.
After his team landed at Los Angeles International Airport, after that they lived in a 4-star hotel near the Airport. Naruto thought to contact Iman but refrained from it. He did not want to get his friend into his mess. They rested for the day and then it took them another day to get over their jetlag. After that day, they needed to get hold of the gang.
"How are we going to find them?" Sangram asked.
"Bro it would be difficult to find such a small gang." Manjot supplied.
"I know, I know. Let me think something." Naruto said, and then he started thinking, where would he find someone who could give him the gang's address? Suddenly, it struck him. He had met a very edgy club owner, who claimed that he could fulfill any person's desire. Then he told the group who were in Manjot's room, that he had to meet someone. After that, he wore a tuxedo and left for LUX, where he wanted to meet the devil, Lucifer Morningstar. That man was the only person who could help him right now.
After a short drive to LUX, he entered the place of sinners. And saw Lucifer in one of his piano performances of I Dreamed A Dream by Susan Boyle, it was a melodious performance. After the end of the performance, he sent a drink to the devil and raised his glass. Then Lucifer approached him, "Mr. Uzumaki what a surprise!"
"Me surprising the devil, has the hell frozen over?" Both of them laughed at that, and then Naruto said, "Well, Mr. Morningstar I am here to ask you for a favor."
"What favor?"
"Well, you do remember the gang I beat up in the alleyway?"
"Yes."
"Well, I require their address, as they have something I am in dire requirement of."
"Well, I do fulfill everyone's desire. You would get it in 10 minutes but I would require something for it."
"What do you want?"
Lucifer then tossed a coin with some satanic diagrams on it towards him and said, "A favor."
Naruto caught it and asked, "What favor?"
"Not now, but I will cash it later." Naruto nodded but felt like he made a deal with the devil [no pun intended]. After 10 minutes, he got the address of the gang or as they were known as the Avengers biker gang, he had a bloodthirsty smile on his face as he left the club.
"Mazikeen, be a dear and make sure that the police will be involved with him and his group."
"I still do not get what are you doing Lucifer?"
"Just helping a very powerful ally."
"Whatever." Mazikeen rolled her eyes.
"Thank you Mazikeen, also could you clean up the trail of bodies he would leave behind."
"Fiiiiine."
Naruto went into the hotel and called for the brothers to meet him in his room. Once all of them assembled in his room, he spoke, "Well boys suit up we got a gang to beat." Everyone had a bloodthirsty smile and after some time everyone suited but in black suits and went towards the lobby where Naruto asked the receptionist if there were baseball stores nearby. Once he got the address, all of them got in the three cars they rented, and first, they went to the baseball store to buy some metal bats, then they stopped at the hardware store to buy some metal rods and after that, they stopped at the gun store, which shocked the brothers as no such stores were there in India. Here Naruto said he only would enter the home.
Once he entered the gun store, looked around to see if anyone was in the shop or not and then looked at the shop owner and cast a genjutsu on him. "Hello good sir can I get eleven CZ-100s"
The owner in a monotone voice said, "Yes" and then handed his eleven .handguns
"Well, I might return some of these later, Could I also have 11 mags for these guns and a silencer" The shopkeeper nodded and gave him the eleven mags and the silencer.
He exited the shop and headed to the first car and handed them four guns and then did the same to the second car and handed the last two in his car as they left for the gang's hideout. After some time they had to park the car near the entrance alleyway. Then all of them walked out of the car and Naruto addressed them, "Boys take the bats or the rods and remember we don't shoot until they shoot but still unlock your guns just in case. Let's break some legs boys."
"Aye aye, captain," Manjot said jokingly. Then with bats and rods in their hands, they entered the alleyway where Naruto said, "Remember boys, No Mercy."
The first victims were the four goons who were smoking outside the building. Ranjit, Man, Gurnoor, and Manjot swung their bats on their heads, making their heads bleed and effectively shutting them up. Once they did that, Naruto took his gun out attached the silencer, and then shot the front wheels of the twenty-nine bikes parked there. Naruto then said, "There are twenty-five goons inside. We will have the shock advantage, but then there will be gunfire, beware."
All of them nodded, and then Balbinder the stereotypical big guy of the group stood in front of the door and kicked it very hard. The door opened with a bang, and the goons at the bar were shocked. All of the brothers barged in and started assaulting the first five goons eating there. With the metal bats and rods, they hit them with all of the anger they had, breaking their legs, shoulders, throats, and heads, nothing was spared as they turned them into mush. That is when the five other goons who came out of their shock, took out their guns and started open firing, thankfully no bullets hit the brothers, since the gang members were intoxicated the bullets did not hit the intended people. Immediately the brothers took cover under tables, chairs, and behind human shields and started firing in retaliation but could not do so much as they had SMGs with them and were firing them like madmen.
That is when Manjot and Naruto made eye contact and nodded to each other. Naruto tapped Jetta who was beside him, on the shoulder and signaled him to give him to give his extra mag and then he and Manjot snuck from the sides until they were behind the gang members, and then both of them opened fire and killed the five members. Naruto reloaded his gun and then both of them open-fired on the staircase killing three more members who came up hearing the sound of gunfire.
The brothers regrouped and Naruto handed the two SMGs to Palveer and Jetta after checking the bullets in them. "Palli [nickname for Palveer], Jetta you will lead and the rest of you will follow them while Manjot and I will follow you covering your back. Kill everyone in the basement except for the leader. The guy is a fatso, bald with a huge ass beard which looks like extended pubes. Show him our special hospitality and make sure that he can speak after the hospitality." They nodded and went down the stairs with Palli and Jetta leading them and Manjot and Naruto covering their backs.
Once inside the basement, they were met with a cocaine deal going on and opened fire on both of the parties bar the biker gang leader, and then tied the unconscious guy to a chair while pilling the bodies to a corner. Then Naruto's phone rang and saw it was Shivansh calling him. "Boys rough him up. I have to take this call." With he went upstairs. While the cries of pain and mercy were coming from downstairs, he was on a call with Shivansh who gave the phone to Shrishti and they chatted for a while, asking about how was everything on their end, how was he, and a lot more questions. After a good five-minute call, he again went downstairs and saw the guys beaten up badly. He turned to Sangram and asked, "He can still speak right?"
Sangram replied by saying, "We broke his legs, his hands, shoulder and ribs, gave him a minor concussion. So yeah he can speak."
"Fine, let's wake him up," Naruto said and he dug his two fingers in the glenohumeral cavity [the cavity of shoulder blades.] and the guy screamed and writhed as he woke up. When he saw Naruto's face he pissed himself as he remembered what Naruto did to him. Naruto saw his horror-stricken face and sadistically smiled and said, "Oh you do remember me!"
"You-you demon!" He freaked out.
"Mate, you are wrong, I am no demon. I am just a human who is good at what he does." Naruto replied.
"Bro, how did you scare him so much?" K.P. asked to which Naruto recounted as to what happened that day.
"Damn bro, that was a little too sadistic," Sangram said.
"Nah, this son of a bitch tried to take my gramps's watch, I will beat him up." Naruto defended himself and then continued, "Anyways, you pig you have something I require." He roughly grabbed both the man's cheeks with one hand as he put the gun to his head.
"What is his name?" Naruto asked him.
"Who?" he replied. Suddenly Naruto shot him in the foot. He screamed and wailed as Naruto inserted his thumb into his bullet wound, "Motherfucker the name of the assassin you sent to my home."
"I don't know the motherfucking Caucasian, who you sent to my house to kill my family member!" With that, he shot on the other thigh as the leader writhed in pain. That is when the leader realized who he was enquiring about.
"I know who you are talking about!" He cried out.
"Then BARK!"
"He was a former member of the gang before he went out to be an assassin. His handler, Aubrey Morale is in the States. I know his address and his number." He wheezed out. Naruto then took out a paper and pen and then said, "Write it down!"
After he jotted it down, Naruto looked at Sangram and said "I am going to confirm the number, keep an eye on him." They nodded as he went upstairs to confirm the handler's number. He dialed the number and waited for Aubrey to pick up.
"Hello"
"Is this Mr. Aubrey Lamar from Pacific Airlines? I am Kendrick Graham speaking."
"I am not Aubrey Lamar, wrong number."
"You are not Aubrey Lamar? Then who are you?"
"I am not Aubrey Lamar, I am Aubrey Morale."
"Oh, I am so sorry."
"No Problem."
Naruto walked downstairs. Everyone looked at him as he said, "The information matched, he is telling the truth."
"Please spare me! I told the truth. Please spare me!" The leader pleaded with them, Naruto leaned on his ear and whispered, "Never trust a shinobi." With that, he shot him in the head after which he addressed the brothers, "Let's wreck the place and get the bodies in the basement." They nodded and Manjot and Jetta went to work on pulling the bodies downwards and stuffing the bodies in the corner of the basement while the rest of the boys wrecked the place.
As they left after some time, Mazikeen entered the place and saw the wrecked state of the place as whistled, "Damn, they did some work!" after which she entered the basement and saw the pile of dead bodies, and then with some demonic magic, she started melting the bodies one by one, until there were no bodies left to melt, after which she called Lucifer to tell him that the job was done.
Meanwhile, Naruto and the gang were washing the bats and pipes they rented to return as there was no need for those things now. Once returned they went to the weapon shop where they bought the CZ-100 and bought more mags for them. Then they straight up went to their hotel to plan for their trip.
"So where are we going?" Gippi asked
"Well, he wrote Riverside, Austin, Texas," Naruto replied.
"How are we going there?" Jetta asked.
"Via road, it's almost 20 hours from here and add a few for some pit stops, so a day journey." Naruto replied and then continued, "Pack up some essential things for a two-day journey. We leave in the late afternoon. Let's check out." They nodded and left to pack in their respective rooms. Once done they checked out of the hotel, rented three big SUVs for three days, and loaded their baggage once done with that, they went to their local Walmart store to stock for their trip. Once stocked up completely with 20 gallons of water, some snacks, pillows, etc. After which they went towards a gas station to get some fuel.
As they reached the station, they first filled petrol in their three SUVs then bought 10 gallons of emergency fuel for their trip and were going to leave when Naruto noticed two distressed teenage girls. "Manjot, Balbinder you guys go first I will catch up with you guys and do me a favor and take Happy and Gippi with you guys, I will follow you guys after some time." Balbinder and Manjot were a bit shocked but reluctantly agreed.
It was Naruto's bleeding heart that he approached the young girls. He stood in front of them and asked, "Hello girls, I am Naruto Uzumaki, may I know your name?"
The girls looked at each other and then spoke up, the blond one said, "I am Lily." While the ravenette said, "I am Rose."
"Hello Lily, Rose are you lost here?" Naruto asked, and they meekly nodded. Naruto then asked, "Was there any elder present with you?"
Both of them nodded and then Lily said, "Yes, our big sister was with us."
"What is her name?"
Rose replied, "Zoe Nightshade"
"Ok Rose, Do know where Ms. Nightshade went?"
"Yes! She said that we would camp at the Sunrise Valley Park [A fictional park]."
"Ok, listen, both of you, since I am not really from here so let me ask someone where the park is and then let me guide you there, alright?" Naruto said as the girls excitedly nodded. Then he approached a random lady at the gas station, "Excuse me miss."
"Yes?"
"Miss, could you tell me where Sunrise Valley Park is?"
"Yes! Well, you have to go straight from here and then take the first left, after which the first right and then first left and it will be on your left side."
"Thank you very much, ma'am." After that, he started talking to the girls, he said, "Well now we know where it is, so I will guide you, we can go in my car, but it would be uncomfortable for you so we will go on foot."
Both of them nodded, and all three of them started on the journey to Sunrise Valley Park. It was a twenty minutes long journey but it was a fun one, all of them conversed with each other and reached inside the park. Once inside the park, Naruto turned towards them and said, "Lily, Rose, follow me closely." Both the girls nodded and followed him closely and they reached the camp where Naruto approached a woman, "Excuse me"
"Yes" the woman replied
"Do you know someone called Zoe Nightshade?"
"I am Zoe Nightshade, who art thou?"
"Sorry?"
"I said who art thou?" As she repeated the question, another woman approached them, "Sorry about her, she is a method actor, I am Phoebe." Phoebe introduced herself.
"Hello."
"So, who are you and why are you here?"
"Oh myself Naruto Uzumaki and I believe these two girls are with you." Naruto introduced himself and then pushed the two girls forward.
"Lily! Rose!" Zoe cried and hugged them while Naruto and Phoebe continued conversing, "Mr. Uzumaki thank you very much."
"No problem, found them stranded at the gas station, so had to help them due to my bleeding heart."
"I cannot thank you enough."
"No problem with that, well I will get going, again please make sure that everyone is accounted for. I will get going bye Lily, bye Rose!"
"Bye, Mr. Naruto!" Both of them said as Naruto left that is when Zoe ordered, "Bows down, the man has left!"
Then both the elders started talking, "Thank the gods, both of them are safe."
"Yes, otherwise Lady Artemis would have been very cross with us."
"It has been 4 years right?"
"Yes, 6 more years to go."
While the ladies were talking, Naruto was leaving mumbling to himself, "Sheesh, bows stretched on me, was it a summer camp or a boot camp." After that, he sat in his car and started driving speedily to cover up the one-hour-long gap between him and his brothers. After a long one-and-a-half-hour drive he caught up with them and they stopped for a petrol and food break after a short time, Happy and Gippi returned to Naruto's car while the brothers drove into the evening to the night, and then by the morning, the entered the state of Texas. And by the afternoon they entered the city of Austin Texas. Before going and finding the handler the boys first roamed around the city to find a good Indian restaurant to eat. Due to beef consumption being a big sin in Hinduism, they took a long time and found a good homely restaurant and ate like homeless people.
After eating their lunch they went towards Riverside to find the person but the place was a bit crowded it was decided that one from each car would go out and manually search for the house. So, Balbinder, Sangram, and Naruto went to each lane of the district to find out about the house. All of them were going from person to person asking for the address's direction. That is when a future couple met for the first time.
As Naruto was asking person to person rear the banks of the Colorado River, He saw a lady walking by with baggy jeans and a silver top and auburn hair with a messy bob cut. He tapped her shoulder and asked, "Excuse me miss?"
As she turned around, her face took Naruto's breath away. If it was a Bollywood movie then at that moment cherry blossoms would have flown in between them and then they would have been instantly transported to the lush fields of Europe where they would have been romantically dancing to a romantic song and almost kissing at the end. Fortunately or unfortunately for him, he was not in a Bollywood movie and in real-time.
But in our modern time, Romeo could not say shit. How could he? He was too busy drowning in her beautiful silver eyes with could even beautify the reflection of the moon. He thought those eyes were the most beautiful and precious thing in the world. Her eyes were drawing him in. They were hypnotizing him, so much so that he did not know what he was saying.
"Hi, I'm Naruto." He did not know why he said his real name as he was going with his fake name Vidyut. But those eyes were telling him to tell the truth.
Then he heard a soft and melodious voice tell him, "I am Artemis."
What the Romeo did not know is that his Juliette is feeling the same way. Artemis, the goddess of hunt and moon was mesmerized by the person in front of her. Being the goddess of hunt she has an incredible sense of smell. Her sense of smell could tell her about the intentions of beings she smelled. When she smelled her prey, she smelled fear and hostility. When she smelled her parents [Zeus, Leto] and Apollo, she smelled Love and adoration same with her favorite sister and aunt, Athena and Hestia respectively.
But when she smelled him, it was a nice smell. A hypnotic smell, it was telling her to lower her walls against him and invite him inside her world, when he introduced himself as Naruto, she did not know what possessed her to say her real name to him as she was now going by the name Luna. But not only his smell, his eyes spoke a lot about him. Those sapphire eyes had drawn her in and she could tell that he was also drawn into her.
Both of them did not say anything but looked into each other. "You have beautiful eyes." "You have a nice smell" They simultaneously said to each other and were embarrassed but during that kodak moment a speed boat rushed past them ruining the moment, that was the moment for the first time Naruto wanted to kill someone without any reason. Sure he was on a killing spree but it was in the name of revenge but that speed boat driver ruined it for him.
They awkwardly cleared their throats and then Naruto asked her "Well, Artemis could you tell me where this address is?"
Artemis read the address and then said, "Sorry I don't know, I am a tourist here."
"Yeah, me too." He said and then awkwardly said, "Well thank you Artemis."
"You're welcome Naruto." She liked the way his name rolled off her tongue.
What the couple did not know was that three pairs were seeing their moment of eyes. Both of them parted ways not before looking over their shoulders to take a peek at each other. Once Naruto reached Balbinder and Sangram he put his game face on but it was too late, both had shit-eating grins on their faces.
Before Naruto could tell them something, Sangram started singing, "Haan mujhe pyaar hua, pyaar hua, allah miya [Title of the song is the same] [Translation is 'God I am in love']."
"Motherfucker, I will kick your damn ass." As Naruto said that, they all started laughing while Naruto was thinking about Artemis. Not knowing that her Romeo was thinking about her, she approached her mother, who was grinning like a madwoman. As she approached her, Leto teased her, "So, I like your smell huh?"
"Ma!" she embarrassingly cried.
"Huhuhu, So, what is my son-in-law's name?" Leto teased her again.
"Mom no!" Artemis cried while thinking about Naruto.
Naruto meanwhile was talking to his brothers, "Did anyone find the location?" asked Naruto.
"I found it," Sangram said to them.
"Let's go then, Sangram can lead us," Balbinder said.
All of them went and sat in their cars, with Sangram's car leading them, and then after some time, they arrived at a big bungalow. All of them got out of the car and then saw the bungalow and saw that the lights were on. So they went the classic way, where the rest of them hid on the sides and Naruto rang the bell.
"Yes." The person opened his door.
"Is this Aubrey Morale?" Naruto asked with an innocent face.
The man with a confused and suspicious face asked, "Yes, but who are you and what do you want?"
Naruto with a bright smile replied, "Ok good!"
Before the man could counter the reply, Naruto socked his jaw hard enough to knock him out cold on his door. The brothers came out from the sides and K.P. commented, "Damn bro that was a mean right hook."
"Well, that hook would land on your face if you don't drag his body inside now." Naruto joked.
With that, they dragged the unconscious man in and then sat the man on the chair and then tied him up, and put a black bag over his face. After this they searched the bungalow to find things about their assassin, thankfully the search was short-lived and they found an already-opened laptop. As Jetta and Palveer found the laptop they immediately hollered the rest to come here, "Guys we found something."
There was a quick response to that and the brothers assembled at the room. Naruto then said, "Man, crack this shit up and give me something good." As he said that Ranjit from downstairs hollered, "Guys, he is starting to get up."
With that, the boys went down while Man started going through every nook and cranny of the computer to find something useful. While he was doing that, all of them gathered around the tied-up man.
As Aubrey woke up, he only saw darkness in front of him before the intense rays of light pierced his eyes causing it to squint when the bag was removed from his head. "Ah, good evening Aubrey!" Naruto jovially said.
"Who are you?" he rasped out.
"Oh right, you might not know me." He innocently said turning grim, "But you might know her." As he said that he took out a picture and put it in front of his face. As he saw the picture, his face rapidly paled. Naruto saw that and said in a psychopathic voice, "Oh so do know her." And out of nowhere shot his shoulder and he cried when Naruto forcefully pressed his shoulder and ragingly whispered, "She might just be another paycheque for you, but she was my motherfucking grandmother that you assigned the assassin and killed!" While he said that he pushed his shoulder more causing Aubrey to cry more in pain.
Before he could torture him further Man hollered from upstairs, "Bro I found something, you might want to see it!" Naruto loomed at Manjot and said, "Make sure this son of a bitch does not move even an inch." Naruto quickly went upstairs, "Man, what happened?"
Naruto went in and saw Man opening an Excel sheet. "Bro good you here, this excel sheet has all the information of every assassination month-wise for this year. So I searched the Excel sheet, and then I found grandma's data here." Naruto saw the highlighted row. Then Man said while pointing at the row, "Bro, look, so row goes as, serial number followed by the picture of the target, then name of target, then the date of beginning of operation and finish date followed by the name of the assassin, followed the mobile numbers of the contractor, since the names are anonymous could not get the name but thankfully the computer was connected to the internet so I searched in the database and found that the numbers were under the name of Abrar Haq and Ruksana Haq."
While Man was telling him the details, the gears in Naruto's head were spinning at the speed of a Formula One wheel. When he saw the commencing date, it was early April and the finish date was Dhriti's death anniversary. And then the name Ruksana, it was someone who he knew but it was not Ruksana Haq but Ruksana Bashir. The number was of Iman but a stubborn part of him wanted to deny the facts that were in front of him, so he told Man,
"Man, do me a favor, call this Ruksana Haq a Pacific Airlines employee, and call her Kathy Wood. And then make sure she tells him her real name." Man, a bit weirded out by the request as he just said her name but did comply.
"Hello"
"Is this Ms. Kathy Wood from Pacific Airlines? I am Tobey Mathers speaking."
"I am not Kathy Wood, wrong number."
"You are not Kathy Wood? Then who are you?"
"I am not Kathy Wood, I am Ruksana Bashir."
"Oh, I am so sorry."
"No Problem."
Man once over with his phone call, had a confused face. Naruto noticing his confused face asked him, "What happened?"
"It's confusing bro, the first name match, but instead of Ruksana Haq, she called herself Ruksana Bashir." While Man was musing that, he missed the murderous face of Naruto. Naruto immediately left the room, not before telling Man to copy all the information on a Hard Drive. As he came downstairs, he saw that Aubrey was still tied up on the chair, so he entered the room and tightly slapped him on his face, breaking one of his teeth in the process. The loud slap gathered everybody's attention as Naruto looked into his eyes with a murderous look and some killing intent and asked, "The woman who gave you the information have you ever seen her face?!" Aubrey rapidly nodded.
Naruto further interrogated, "Was she a Muslim woman with a mole near her left eye?" he again rapidly nodded. "Do you remember the assassin's name you sent to kill my grandmother?" he rapidly nodded and then said, "I know him and the group, we get contracts and then we sent assassins to get the job done, your case the assassin was Mike Fallon since the killing needed to look like an accident! I can also tell you their hideout, it's in England!"
"Ok, Palveer jot down the address." Only he squeaked the address, Naruto said, "Jetta undo his binds."
"Bro!" Jetta protested.
"Just do it." Jetta reluctantly did it and the Naruto sat on the table to face Aubrey and said, "Aubrey, do you know what I hate more than an assassin?"
"What?"
"A motherfucking rat!" And shot him in the head, killing him in an instant. After which Naruto said, "Sangram, pass me the water bottle." He drank the water and then poured it down his face. After taking a deep breath, he screamed and shot Aubrey's dead body until his magazine was empty and then kicked his body down along with the chair.
Everyone was startled by the action of Naruto and only Manjot dared to ask him, "Bro calm down and tell us what happened?"
"Son of bitch, I was friends with a fucking snake in saint's clothing and played into his schemes." He raged.
"Bro, can you elaborate?" K.P. asked to which Naruto explained them about his foreign trip, about Iman and Ruksana Bashir, and what Man told him. By the time he ended his tale, not just him but everyone was equally angry as they were taught to never stab in the back of your friend. "Now what?" Man, who was spooked by the commotion came down and heard his tale, asked.
"Man, hack into the UK server to make us UK visas. Till then let me make a call to the snake." Naruto ordered and then venomously said.
"Will do." Man said and left upstairs to work on Aubrey's computer. Naruto went outside and then called Iman, "Iman Brother!" He called
"Ranvijay! How are you, brother?"
"I'm good, sorry had to leave, my grandmother died."
"My condolences"
"Thank you, but I am returning to the US in a week."
"Oh that's great, I am here for a month, so do come!"
"Sure brother!" He cut the call with a bad taste in his mouth as he mumbled to himself, "My condolences, MY FOOT!"
He went inside not before parking their car in Aubrey's garage and they rested for the night in Aubrey's house not before clearing up their mess. By the morning every one of them was on the breakfast counter, Man spoke up, "Bro when do you want to book the ticket for the UK, the visas are ready they are the same types as our US ones?"
Instead of answering Man's question, Naruto asked Balbinder, "Balli the car we rented was from a franchise model rental right?"
"Yes, Why?"
"Ok then, Man, get us the midnight ticket for L.A. and the tickets for the night flight to the UK."
"Bro, why today afternoon, weren't we going for tomorrow?" Balbinder asked. To which Naruto replied,
"Kaal kare so aaj kar. Aaj kare so ab [Translation: 'Do tomorrow's work today and today's work now]."
They nodded and by the afternoon they had returned their car and were on the plane to L.A. Once landing in L.A. they rented 2 big 7-seaters and went towards an inn to stay for the day. Once checked in, Naruto told them to stay while he bought so guns for them during that time, he to Ranjit to modify the range of the signal jammer that they took from Aubrey's house, enough for 2 acres of land, and gave them some cash to get the necessary items for the modification and left to buy guns for them. Once they were done with buying the guns and the signal jammer ready, they left for Iman's house to kill the couple.
Meanwhile LUX, L.A.
Lucifer who had been informed by Mazikeen of the destruction and murder of the biker gang, and that Naruto was now in L.A. and also his plan. Lucifer called Mazikeen.
"What do you want Lucifer?"
"Ah Mazikeen, don't you think that our friend from the veil is quite interesting?"
"If your interest means the way he kills people left and right, then sure."
"Well, you see, he is going to kill a married couple now who had wronged him."
"So, what?"
"Well, I want you to make sure that the LAPD does not interfere in his endeavor and my show does not get ruined for me."
"Arrgh Fine" Mazikeen let out a pained groan.
Back with Naruto
Once they were geared and suited up, Naruto led the pack wearing a Persian blue suit and a matching shirt, while the rest went with Black suits and white shirts. They got in their car and after a few minutes' drive, they reached their location, Iman Bashir's Mansion. Naruto looked towards Ranjit and said, "Ranjit, get the signal jammer ready, on my signal." Ranjit nodded.
Naruto then pulled out his phone and dialed the house number, "Hello" Ruksana replied.
"Hello Ruksana," Naruto said. And Ruksana recognized his voice and said,
"Ranvijay! Sorry Iman is not here."
"Oh don't worry. I am not calling him, Ruksana Haq."
"What?!" Naruto heard her throat close.
"Oh I know you, you know my real name, you and that son of a bitch you call your husband."
Before she could talk, he continued, "Oh don't worry do call me Naruto Uzumaki, after all, you did give the contract to kill my grandmother, Dhriti Ghosh Agarwal. How do I know this? Well, a certain dealer squealed to me."
"What do you want?!" Ruksana said in a hostile voice.
"I want you to pray to your god. You are going to die right now." As Naruto said that he immediately signaled Ranjit to activate the signal jammer and cut the phone.
After the phone cut, Ruksana's first action was to call her husband but due to the signal being jammed, she could not contact him. Then she called 911 with, the same result. So she went to check the security cameras and saw that Naruto and the boys taking out their weapons from the car and marching towards her door. When she did that, she knew that she would die but she decided, that if she had to die, she would go down guns blazing, so she took out her handgun and got ready.
On the other side, the boys took out their guns, which ranged from rifles to SMGs. And then broke down the front door with Balbinder, K.P., Sangram, and Man leading the pack as they entered. Once they passed the lobby to go inside the house, they were met with a fearless Ruksana who was ready to sacrifice her life. She had her gun pointed towards the incoming crowd and then when she encountered Balbinder and Man, she pulled the trigger.
Man and Balbinder saw the gun and widened their eyes as they saw the trigger getting pulled. Thankfully the gun was locked and as nothing came out of the barrel, Man lunged towards her to disarm her. In the scuffle, the gun accidentally unlocked and she pulled the trigger and the bullet grazed Man's thigh and he writhed on the ground. Then Balbinder tried to get a hold of her but was kicked on his pelvis [nuts]. Then she socked K.P. and punched Sangram in the stomach. Before she could kill them, three bullets were fired, and K.P. saw blood on her face and saw a bullet lodged on her forehead one in her lungs, and one in her heart. Then he saw the gun that shot her, in the hand of Naruto.
Naruto looked at the four men on the ground and then said, "That is why you don't underestimate a person even though she is a homemaker." Then he sighed and said, "Gurnoor. Get the first aid for Man. And everybody else, search the house to find the son of a bitch." With that, he also helped in the search by barging in his private room. When he searched the house he found a journal, where he found where he was. He quickly made a shadow clone, "Go to the convention and put the genjutsu."
Then he hollered the rest of the boys, "Guys I found the fucker!" All the boys immediately came there. "Where?" Jetta asked. Then he raised the journal. "This fucker kept his journal here, I saw it and saw he was in some convention 5 blocks down the road, let's go there." Then as they were leaving, Naruto made some shadow clones to raid the house for some valuables. As they were leaving, it was decided that Man would sit back in the car to rest his injured leg and control the signal jammer.
After a short drive, they reached the block. Once the car stopped, Naruto got out while lighting a cigarette, then all the boys got out except for Man, who all gathered at the back of the second car to get the guns. Once they armed themselves they walked into the convention building with their sunglasses on. As they entered the lobby they opened fire on the guards there and then Naruto opened the hall door as the guards pointed the guns at him they were immediately shot by the brothers. Chaos spread throughout the hall, as people started screaming, and to control them the brother told them to be silent while making the shushing motion. Then they pointed their guns and fired some warning shots all the while telling them to close their eyes and sit down, as the while Naruto slowly marched towards Iman and stared him down.
Iman saw him and knew his death was near as he got his late wife's page [for all the Gen Z the message from a pager] about her death. Then K.P. climbed the podium and announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to do something. It's a two-minute job and won't take much time. If you just, [K.P. load his gun] close your eyes." All the while Naruto was just staring blankly at Iman. K.P.'s announcement and a little force from the other brothers, the guests slowly started to close their eyes. That is when Iman, showing some courage, stood up. All the while Naruto was looking into his eyes like a predator ready to devour his prey. Then he put his hand on his shoulder which when Iman forcefully removed it, turned into a chokehold and Naruto brought both of them down to the ground. Manjot and Gurnoor looking were looking at the ongoing murder. After writhing for a good few minutes, Naruto felt Iman was unresponsive, so he released the hold and flipped his body to his side while catching his breath. He then stood up and tapped Gippi, motioning him to give his rifle. Gippi reluctantly and slowly gave his weapon while softly saying, "Bro, he is already dead."
But Naruto was in no mood to listen, as the gun reached his hand, he took it and loaded it. He then fired three shots simultaneously at the dead body handed the gun to Gippi and started leaving the hall, he passed Manjot to whom he said, "Bro take the dead body with us. We will bury him with his wife." And with that, the four of them lifted his body and all of them left the hall. As soon as they left the hall, the genjutsu Naruto previously cast came into effect as the attendees forgot the previous action, and the person named Iman Bashir, and the convention continued as if nothing happened. The only person who remembered it was Mazikeen. She saw everything that was going on and was impressed by the boldness and brutality and went to tell Lucifer about it.
As they left the hall they stopped at the house, where they picked up Ruksana's body and then left for the burial ground. After the burial they went towards the Bashir house, where they left Man to rest. As they entered the house, they saw the house was spick and span. And they went upstairs to meet Man. As they entered his room, he was doing something on their computer. Naruto then called him, "Man, the work I gave you. Is it done?"
"Yes bro, this property is now in your name."
"Good, now list it on the auction site."
After 5 minutes the auction began and the house sold for 187 million dollars, as Naruto predicted, since this house was on a hot property. The moment the money was transferred into his account, five minutes later a guy came to collect the house keys, by that time they had taken all the valuables and then they left to sell them. The valuables had given them a good 20,000 dollars. After spending some of the dollars on a hearty dinner, they converted the rest of the dollars into pounds and left for the airport.
As they were waiting for their flight, he looked towards the moon, and his mind was filled with thoughts about a certain silver-eyed lady who had infested his thoughts whenever he looked at an auburn lady or anything silver. "Who are you Artemis? Why did I never feel this for any other person?" He thought, not knowing that someone else was resonating with his thought process. Miles away the lady who had infested his thoughts had been also infested by Naruto. The whole day somehow or the other, something reminded me of that man. "Why? Why are you still in my mind?"
Not knowing that both of them were thinking about each other, Naruto boarded his flight to the UK. And after a 12-hour flight, all of them landed in the UK. The first thing they did was to take a train and an hour later they de-boarded at Winchester. They then went to search for a hotel, and after resting for the night they were ready for the final massacre.
Oasis, Winchester
If someone looks at Oasis from the outside, it is a normal pub. But for the black market, it was a hub of assassins. So when Naruto walked into the bar, he was mentally ready to fight. Once he had entered, he started evaluating the hoard of assassins present there. He ordered a glass of beer, and his first target was a goliath of a man, from listening around he got his name, Carnage Cliff. By looking at his physique, he deduced that the guy is a brute and his favorite weapon is an axe.
Then he ordered 5 shots of Jaegerbomb and started evaluating a pair of twins sitting behind him, from what he could see they were some kind of special ops, and when he heard their conversation, he guessed that they were good in chemical weaponry. After the Jaegerbomb, he ordered gin to wash down his throat and evaluated a nerd whose name he got was Finicky Fred. The guy was not physically not so great and his assassination skills were in weird inventions. Then he ordered vodka while looking at his next target, a seductress, they call Jane the Ripper, from what he got she was a good swordswoman. Then he started talking to their ring leader, the bartender, who had a rifle under the bar. "Hey mate bill me up." He said in his best British accent.
"Yeah, sure. Your bill is 100 pounds"
"That's expensive."
"Well yeah, that's economy."
"Thanks, mate"
"You are welcome."
From what he got on the guy, his name was Big Ray, ex-military and was the boss of the gang, also he found out that Mike Fallon was out of town and would come back that evening and would visit the bar at late night so he had to get the job done by the evening and with that, he left for his hotel. Once he reached the hotel, he called for a meeting between the brothers.
"Ok boys, we have 6 motherfuckers on our targets, first is a pair of twins, they are special ops with a specialization in chemistry." Before he could say further, Manjot interrupted,
"Leave them to Jetta and me." Jetta nodded. Naruto then continued, "Ok, fuck with that, then let's talk about the next target, Finicky fed-" he produced a photo "- he is an inventor assassin, not physically endowed." He was this time interrupted by Happy,
"Gippi and I will take him on." He said. Naruto then continued, "Ok, then the seductress, Jane the ripper,-" he showed the photo "- she is a seductress, and is very good with a katana."
"Gurnoor and I will take her on." Man declared.
"Ok, then is the big guy, Carnage Cliff-" he showed them the photo, "-This guy is a heavy hitter, he swings his axe. Balbinder, can you handle him?"
"Yeah, Palveer and I can handle him." Balbinder replied, after which he said, "The final guy is this guy, Big Ray."
"Leave the guy to me and Ranjit," Sangram said.
With that all of them got ready and that evening they went towards the bar. Once they broke down the door, it was a 5 minutes affair as they had the element of surprise. Once they broke down the door, Balbinder attacked and restrained Carnage while Palveer to his axe and chopped at his neck, while that was going on Manjot and Jetta were in direct combat with the special ops twins, Mic and Mike. During that time, Happy and Gippi chucked two knives at Finicky Fred, one at his forehead and another at his heart. While the brothers were done first, the same could not be said for Man and Gurnoor as they were in a straight duel with Jane the Ripper. During the duel, Jane kicked Man on the pelvis and was going to stab him but she felt a searing pain as Gippi stabbed her on the spine, as she was distracted, Gurnoor slashed his head. Meanwhile Happy helped in killing the special ops twins. While all that was going on, Sangram shot Big Ray in the shoulders so that he could shoot the shotgun and restrained him. At that time Naruto walked in.
"Yello! Big Ray!" Naruto walked in jovially.
"You?!" Ray looked at Naruto and recognized him.
"Why me yes! You see these are all my brothers. And now you will give your phone to contact that son of a bitch, Mike Fallon."
"Never!"
"Put a sock in his mouth! And here is the phone."
Naruto pulled out the phone and called Mike, and as he picked up the phone,
"Mike?"
"Sike!"
"Who are you?!"
"Your death Motherfucker!"
"Where is Ray?!"
"Oh he is alive, cannot say the same about your little assassin gang, though I am a good guy so I will let him talk to you." "Mhmm!" Ray grunted.
"Ray!" Bang!
"Oops! I pulled the trigger!"
"You son of a whore!"
"I will let you know, my mother was a respectable woman. And as for Big Ray, take his corpse from me at Coke Park [fictitious park]. See you tonight! Oh by the way Aubrey ratted you guys out!"
With that, he cut the call and said, "Wait for me in the hotel and give me this guy's severed head." With that, he took the head and left for the park.
Coke Park
Mike Fallon was a Caucasian man. He was Brit, 6', and had black hair and a light beard. And his emotions were of a storm. He was raging as his mentor was just killed on the phone, so fuck meeting his girlfriend he went to the Coke Park to kill that fucker who killed his mentor. So, he took his Triumph Thunderbird and went towards the said park. As he entered the park and raged at what he saw.
Naruto was sitting there and he saw Mike entering the park. He kicked the head at Mike's feet angering him. As he rushed and said, "I am here, come out you fucker!"
"So the assassin finally comes out!" As Naruto came out of the shadow, Mike felt like he knew him. Naruto read his face and said, "You seem to think that you remember me or not, well let me jog your memory! I am the grandson of the person you recently killed in West Bengal, India."
As Naruto said that, Mike's face drained of any color, Naruto had vindictive pleasure seeing Mike's face, "Oh! Now you remember, huh?"
Naruto then took off his suit and rolled off his sleeves, punched Mike in the face and axe-kicked him, sending him flying. Mike shook away his shock and punched him, after which he kicked his thigh, Naruto fell and Mike socked a good left hook on his face, making Naruto spit some blood. Naruto stood up as Mike was going to punch him. Naruto grabbed his arm and twisted it and as Mike forcefully freed himself, he ripped his shirt in the process. As he staggered to the ground, he slashed Naruto's left solar plexus. Naruto grunted in pain but did not notice that his emergency summoning tattoo had been activated and now only required some chakra, which was fulfilled as Kyuubi's charka spread through his body, and did not know which tiger was summoned.
Baatora had been summoned to see the fight. Once she was summoned, she was about to call Naruto about where she was, but when she saw the fight, she let both of the boys fight it out.
Naruto did not notice Baatora there and continued fighting. He hooked Mike on the face while not noticing the Nine-Tails, the one-tailed cloak had covered him, and that Naruto swung two hooks on his face effectively closing his left eye. Naruto was angered as the second tail sprouted out and started repeatedly punching and he punched square in his chest effectively shutting down his heart and repeatedly punched him. By the time the third tail sprouted he created a Rasengan and hit square on his chest then with his enlarged nails ripped his heart, crushed it, and ripped his head from the rest of the body.
Baatora had enough, as she saw a fourth tail growing. She immediately took out a suppressor seal and before that, she took out another seal. First, she applied a seal that created a shadow clone and then applied a suppressor seal and knocked him out.
Mount Taigahiru
Naruto woke up with a jerk, as he looked around he found himself in a cave. Then he started recalling what had happened, in which he remembered that, he was mincing Mike Fallon and then he suddenly blacked out. As he was looking around, Baatora entered.
"Oh Naruto-boy, you are up!"
"Baatora, are we in Mount Taigahiru?"
"Why yes!"
"Why am I in here?"
"Well Naruto-boy, what do you remember?"
"I remember that I was fighting someone and then I blanked out, and now I am here."
"Were you really fighting him? Or were you beating a dead man?"
"You were there?!"
"Why yes! I saw you. Kill no ravage the already dead man."
"How?"
"You might not remember but you summoned me."
Then he remembered the blood that sprayed on his emergency summoning tattoo. As Baatora saw his face of realization, she asked about a more pressing issue, "Naruto-boy, I have never seen you so angry, what happened?"
Naruto sighed and then started talking about everything, from his journey to America to the assassination attempt on Dhriti to the murder of Dhriti to his revenge arc. Baatora sighed and asked Naruto, "Naruto-boy, tell me how are you feeling right now?"
Since Baatora asked him, he started to contemplate. He was so blinded by anger he never thought how he was feeling. He was so engrossed in killing left and right that the basic emotions were missing. He started with a whisper, "Why am I not feeling anything?"
Baatora, who could not hear asked, "Sorry Naruto-Boy?"
"WHY AM I NOT FEELING ANYTHING?! WHY AM I NOT FEELING GOOD OR ACOMPLISHED?! WHY?!" Naruto's sudden rage surprised Baatora. She also saw Kyuubi's chakra leaking, she readied the chakra suppressor seal but it was not required as Naruto started breaking down. If someone else saw Naruto without a given context, they would think that
Naruto was having a hysterical breakdown of a hormonal teenager. But Baatora knew what he was going through. She knew that Naruto was not a person big on killing and revenge, so once he came to terms with his action he was having a breakdown and regret about his action.
She put a comforting hand on his sobbing shoulder as he cried, "Why?"
"It is because revenge is never an answer. Do you think Dhriti would have been proud of you?" Baatora softly asked.
Naruto nodded and then Baatora continued, "Naruto, sometimes anger makes us lose everything, but it is never the answer. Shinobi's do kill, but it is to protect their loved ones, not revenge as it only destroys people. Naruto, Dhriti did change your life, now it is your time." with that she left him pondering.
"Heh guess you would be pissed with me, right grandma?" Naruto started talking to himself and continued, "I am sorry. I promise that this won't be the end of me." With that, he left the summoning realm. He ended up in his hotel room and popped his shadow clone. He got all the memories of his clone, where he found that his brothers were worried about him. After gathering the boys he only told one thing, "Let's go home." They took a flight and reached late at night in India.
The next morning, West Bengal, India
Naruto woke up, sobered by last night's conversation with Baatora, and also knew that he had to move on, and what better than to do it just thirteen days after her death. In Hindu traditions, the thirteenth day after someone's death is considered the day, when the soul has departed from the land of living. He went in preparation for the necessary rituals and the feast to remember her.
As the rituals and feast were done by the evening, he was looking at the sunset and its beautiful orange color, the color of freshness. He was determined to let go for a new day, thinking about these experiences, he thought about his friends in elemental nations not knowing that they were discussing about him.
Konohagakure, right after the meeting between the rookies and Tsunade
Due to the secrecy of the situation the Konoha 12 or now 10 and their senseis' met at the Sarutobi couple's house, which was both a secure place and the couple could look after their son instead of their usual YakiniQ place. It was a quiet and sober environment there as many could not believe what their hokage had told them or that their senseis' knew about it but above all they could wrap their head around the fact that their knucklehead friend had gone rogue and abandoned the village. The two people who were the most shocked were Sakura and Hinata, and due to the latter girl's crush on the blonde, she was also heartbroken.
Kiba spoke up, "I can't believe that Naruto would do something like that."
Shino agreed with him and said, "Indeed, it is highly illogical to think that Naruto-san would leave the village."
Chouji then said, "Yeah, he always said that his dream was to be the Hokage. So, him leaving the village will be the last thing that would help him in his dream."
Neji, the more mature of the group said, "Uchiha-san was still believable that he could be a flight risk but Naruto was one that is still unbelievable."
Ino then interjected and asked, "Asuma-Sensei when were you guys sent for the retrieval?"
Asuma Sarutobi the youngest son of Hiruzen Sarutobi said, "Well we were alerted 6 hours after his abandonment, Me, Kurenai, Kakashi, Raido, Genma and Iwashi had gone along with Jiraiya-Sama. His intell said that Naruto had gone towards the land of waves. We went and searched there but found nothing."
Neji then asked something that was bugging him, "Why Jounins led by a Sannin were sent after Naruto and not Genins led by a Chuunin? When we went after the Uchiha, we were all Genins and did not have any Jonin in the mix."
Before any of the Jonins could answer, the answer came from the door, "Because Naruto is far more important than Sasuke in the political scenario of elemental nations."
Everyone looked towards who it was, to see Shikamaru entering the room. "What do you mean by that Shikamaru?" Ino asked him
"Troublesome, if someone were to catch Sasuke and execute him or turn him, we can afford that but not with Naruto." Shikamaru elaborated further as he sat down with the rest.
"But why is that? While we don't know much about Naruto other than him being an orphan under Lord Jiraiya's mentorship, Sasuke is the second-last living Uchiha, surely Sasuke would be a far more enticing bargaining chip" Neji countered him, being raised in the Hyuuga clan, he knew a lot about politics.
"It's not about the outside, it is about the inside." Shikamaru cryptically said, but the Jonins already caught on to what he said.
"So you know?" Asuma asked his student.
"Yes, I stayed after the briefing, and asked somethings that were bugging me and got the troublesome answer." Replied the lazy Nara.
"What?" Chouji asked after munching on his chips.
"Troublesome, it bugged me that in Naruto's case, we had to make sure that we peacefully drag him back to the village and as a last ditch maim him back to the village but no such conditions were given in Sasuke's case. Everything was a fair game even using lethal force. It was our foolish decision that we did not want to use any lethal force on him."
"Now that you say, yes I do recall that." Neji agreed with him.
"But why would Hokage-sama do that?" Shino enquired.
"Yeah, why?" Ino also asked,
Before Shikamaru answered Ino, Kurenai interjected them by asking, "Has Hokage-sama authorized you to tell them the S-Rank secret?"
"Yes, since it was always available for seasoned chuunins and jonins so yeah."
"What authorization?"
Shikamaru sighed and then asked Ino, "Ino, why do you think the adults always advised their kids to stay away from Naruto?"
Ino answered it like it was the most obvious thing in the world, "Well because of his annoying pranks." But was shocked when Shikamaru shook his head and said, "No, Ino you are wrong."
"What?" before she could interrogate further Tenten interjected them by asking, "What has all this to do with the politics?"
Shikamaru sighed and then said, "Everything, this is a troublesome situation, do you think that Yondaime defeated Kyuubi no Kitsune?"
Kiba replied to that by saying, "Yes, everybody knows that."
Tenten then said, "No Kyuubi is a large chakra entity, so they cannot be defeated but can only be sealed."
Guy asked with a shocked face, "How do you know about this Tenten?"
Tenten embarrassed by the spotlight on her, "Well I wanted to research more about fuinjutsu. That is when I learned about the jinchuurikis. Thus I know about it."
Lee interjected them, "But what does this have to do with Naruto-kun?"
Shikamaru sighed and then said, "Troublesome, on which day did Yondaime defeat the Kyuubi?"
"October 10" Lee replied
"When is Naruto's birthday?" Shikamaru asked
Chouji replied, "October 10."
Neji connected the dots and realized, "Naruto is the jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi!"
"Yes, it was the worst kept secret to the masses, the punishment for ratting the secret out was execution so the masses ostracized him," Shikamaru said.
"That explains why is he such a good political chip. But can he survive in the wild?" Neji questioned.
"Easily. Naruto lived on his own, for so long and his mentality is that of survival."
"So what we will bring him back kicking or screaming!"
"Yeah!" Everyone agreed and cheered with him.

Revelations
________________________________________
Sometimes science cannot explain some things, these events or things are generally called magic or a myth and how real they are. And sometimes humans do not know that these mythical beings lived amongst humans to look after their world. But soon two men were going to know about the said things in a pretty interesting way.
Elemental Nations, Konohagakure, Hokage Tower
Inside the Hokage's office, two people were overwatching the conversation of the rookies along with their senseis' with a smile. Jiraiya and Tsunade smiled at the ball, thinking their grandson had good friends. As they looked at the ball, Jiraiya looked at Tsunade seriously and said, "Hime, could we speak in private."
Seeing Jiraiya's serious face, Tsunade nodded and signaled the hidden ANBU to go out and guard behind the doors. As this was happening, Jiraiya extended his senses and found that there were four pests, who clearly were not obedient to their hokage and Jiraiya very well knew how they were. So, instead of saying something, he flung four kunais at four corners of the ceiling and dropped down four burning dead bodies. Tsunade frowned at the burning dead bodies, while Jiraiya remarked, "He is getting bolder." After which he applied a seal disrupting seal and over that applied a privacy seal and turned towards Tsunade.
"Tsunade, I think, I know where he is," Jiraiya said.
"You do?! About Naruto?!" Tsunade asked in an urgent voice.
"Yes. Well you see, Ma and Pa had caught my lie and gave me a beating of a life. Then they told about the veil."
"Veil?"
"Veil, it is from what they told me, was a layer chakra that separates us from the rest of the world and I know before you say it is ludicrous, I have checked it out and it is real and give me two months and I will give you more details."
"Please Jiraiya," Tsunade begged.
"Don't worry Tsu-hime we will bring our grandson back." With that said Jiraiya hugged Tsunade tightly to his chest.
Ghosh House, West Bengal, India
The Das family and the house were near the house, and the Das were supportive of the orphaned siblings. Shrishti after her grandmother's death continued staying with Naruto and had dropped out of the boarding school, while Naruto had gone back to his blonde roots, with cutting and styling his hair back to the blonde look and keeping a clean shave. [For reference it is the Shippuden look.] He had gone through major changes after the feast of the thirteenth day and had since continued his basic training in all the Shinobi areas. During that time Kohaku had visited them and was genuinely sad about Dhriti's passing away and acted like a house cat for supporting Shrishti emotionally. Meanwhile, they still maintained good relations with their neighbors, with the occasional invite for Breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
It was one such day when the siblings were at their neighbors'. While the ladies were in the kitchen, the men were in the living room drinking tea and discussing current affairs and everything else.
"So how has life been treating you?" Shiva asked Naruto.
"Yeah, it's good. A bit hectic, but still good." He replied
"How is she?"
"A bit down. She did not want to go back so, I have been homeschooling her."
"You?" Shiva asked with a raised eyebrow.
"I will have you know Mr. Shivansh Das, I do have a degree in LLB," he said in a mock angry tone while continuing in his head, "Along with B. Tech and several other degrees, thanks to the old hag's persistence and the liberal abuse of shadow clones."
Naruto's response had both the men chuckling as they went back to reading the newspaper and sipping tea. After some time, Naruto amusedly chucked and said, "The balls on this man."
This brought Shivansh's attention, "Huh?"
"You didn't read this Article, 'Belief Cannot Replace Science'"
"About the Setusamudram project?"
"Yes, apparently a report from the Joint Director General of ASI [Archeological Survey of India], Dr. Aryan K. saying that Ramayana is 'an imaginary epic'"
"Really?!"
"Yeah, saying that the Ram-Setu is nothing more than a naturally occurring phenomenon. He is stepping a lot of toes, and this is after Babri Masjid."
"What are your views on this?"
"Sorry?"
"What are your views on Science vs Myths?"
"Well, I think both are equally important."
"How?"
"Well you see, some myths are stories passed through generations as a form of a warning and sometimes it is a part of our history and Science, well I think praising the said field is not enough, though my personal preference is mixing both of them. This way we can find out more about our missing history and also find out if is Ram-Setu called Ram-Setu or should it be known as Adam's Bridge." Both the men chuckled at that.
As the debate was going on between the men, Parvati was watching them. She had seen a gradual shift in the behavior of her husband during the three years. At first, when Shiva came here, he was weary of Naruto and thought of him as a time-ticking bomb but as time passed they both developed a deep brotherly bond and how could she forget about little Shrishti, the little tyke stole her heart completely. She was like Laxmi and Saraswati when they were young goddesses. When she heard about her orphan status, her heart went out to the little girl, and made it a self-mission to be a parental figure in her life. As her cooking was done, she now had to stop the two wannabe intellectuals.
"Ok, now stop both of you philosophical geniuses, breakfast is ready," Parvati said. As she said that, both of them stopped discussing and were eating breakfast along with the ladies.
That afternoon the Ghosh House's landline rang, Naruto picked it up,
"Hello?"
"Hello, I am Manjot"
"Manjot! Hey, so how are you?"
"I am good man, what about you?"
"Yeah I am good too, so why the call?"
"Hey did you hear the recent Ram-Setu news?"
"Yeah about the ASI affidavit, why?"
"Well, the government wanted some military personnel to be the security in-charge for Dr. Aryan when he goes for the on-ground expedition."
"So?"
"Well I am thinking about adding your name to it, they would pay you 60,000 rupees, what do you say?"
"Well, I say YES! Thanks, man it would be a big help."
"No problem bro, I will revert to you tomorrow about the confirmation and then pack your bags for a week's worth of expedition."
"Thanks, Manjot."
"No problem man, Bye."
"Bye."
Meanwhile, Mumbai, India
Dr. Aryan Kumar, an archeologist was sitting in his home with coal rubbed on his face [it a form of disrespect] by the neighbors due to his outrageous affidavit sent to the Supreme Court regarding the Setusamudram case. Due to this case, he had to face a suspension of ten days thanks to his report and now everybody was hating on him. Most at this point would pray to god for any miracle, even his wife did that, but him being a hardcore atheist he refused to do any such thing. To him there was no greater truth than Science, something he would happily die for.
"Professor?" His wife Dr. Gayitri Kumar asked him.
"Yes, Doctor?"
"What's eating you?"
"Nothing."
"Aryan, I know what you are thinking. You played with the masses' religion, didn't you think you would face backlash for it?"
"If you knew, then why did you ask?"
"It's better sometimes, that your husband comes clean to you."
"It's nothing, just that the private company in the Setusamudram project, Pushpak Constructions has given me a chance to back my thesis via ground investigation."
"Please do not tell me, Aryan, you have accepted it!" Since no answer was uttered she knew he had accepted the offer. Seeing his wife's face Aryan tried to placate her, "Gayitri-"
But all of it was in vain as she raged, "Are you out of your goddamn mind! Getting your face blackened didn't give you the pleasure that you want more!"
"Gayitri please, this is important for me." Seeing the desperation in her husband's face, she relented and said, "Ok, but come back safe, alright?"
"Sure, professor."
"Love you, doctor."
"Love you too, professor."
With that he started packing for the life-changing trip, he was about to go on.
The Next Day, West Bengal, India
During the previous evening, Naruto had informed Shrishti about his recent job. After a bit of explaining and coercing Shrishti, it was decided that she would live with the Dases till he was back from the mission, and with that he drove towards the Behala Domestic Airport to take a helicopter to their destination.
Once he reached there, he was greeted by a tall, well-built man with a mustache. He walked up to him and shook his hand while Naruto said, "Nakul Sachdeva"
"Bali Rana," The man said and then continued, "I will be the project manager. We are pleased to have you on board as the head of security."
Naruto smiled and said, "No sir, the pleasure is all mine."
Bali nodded and said, "Well let's get in the chopper and we pick up Dr. Aryan Kumar and then land on Pushpak Alpha." Naruto nodded as they got on the chopper as they left for Mumbai. After a 2 hour long flight, they landed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Airport. Here they were waiting for a while as Dr. Aryan Kumar approached them. The three of them shook each other's hands.
"Bali Rana." "Nakul Sachdeva." They introduced themselves. Then Bali said, "I will be the project manager and Mr. Sachdeva will be the head of security."
"Nice to meet you." Dr. Aryan replied as they boarded the helicopter. They were served snacks and lunch on their 2-hour flight as they reached the historical Ram-Setu. Aryan stood up to see the Ram Setu and the helicopter shook, the pilot warned them about the unpredictable weather of the Ram-Setu as they landed on Pushpak Alpha.
Pushpak Alpha
As they landed on the helipad of the ship, they went straight towards the lab. Both Naruto and Aryan were in awe of the high-tech lab. Bali welcomed them downstairs. All three of them went inside the lab as they looked around and saw the pieces of equipment. While they were walking, they looked at what looked like a deep sea underwater craft. That is when Bali explained that Mr. Indrajit was hell-bent on incorporating everything for the smooth sailing of the research. Then he introduced the two men to the rest of the team of scientists.
"Ladies and Gentlemen" Bali gathered the attention of scientists, "I present to you Dr. Aryan Kumar who specializes in marine archeology, and Nakul Sachdeva, head of security" While Aryan waved and said hi, Naruto nodded. And then Bali continued to introduce the other scientists, "This is Dr. Chandra, he specializes in underwater research. Then Dr. Lily, a geologist who is the world's leading expert in carbon-dating using the AMS [Accelerator Mass Spectrometry] technique."
This shocked Aryan as there was a big AMS machine there, in his shock he said, "No way, this ship has a dedicated AMS machine for carbon-dating." Bali preened and said, "Well, we spared no expense. For this mission, we have all the state-of-the-art technologies."
Then he continued introducing the scientists, "We have Professor Verma, head of remote sensing. He will help you capture the sonar images of Ram-Setu. Then we have Udyan and his team. A team of professional scuba divers, and finally Dr. Sandra Mathews, environmental scientist." Then he explained that along with religious groups, there were environmentalists who were protesting over the project so they wanted to cover their bases, so Sandra would prove that there would be no harm to the environment during the upcoming Setusamudram project.
While Aryan was familiarizing himself with the rest of the team, Bali turned to Naruto, "And for you Nakul, we have state-of-the-art weaponry. We have bulletproof jackets, Glock 22c with endless magazines, and marine and topographical map of the area."
Naruto smiled at that and said, "Well that makes my work a lot easier, so let's get the show on the road."
Bali laughed at that and said, "Well let's do it!"
While both the men laughed, Aryan approached them, "Mr. Bali" This got the said man's attention. "Um... Mr. Bali this all is good but I had also asked for another person on the team."
Bali smiled and said, "Well I was keeping it for the last." He looked and called Udyan and signaled him, as after a few moments a suit which looked like a space suit came down from the ceiling. "Meet Jatayu, your exosuit, which can act like a submarine and can last up to hours in the deep sea. It has inbuilt oxygen and air maintenance along with that there is no danger of decompression sickness. It will be like flying in underwater."
Aryan smiled and said, "Let's go for a dip tomorrow morning."
Bali smiled and said, "As you wish."
Meeting and Research Room
In the Meeting/Research room, they started discussing the Setu, with Dr. Verma discussing the Ram-Setu and Sonar Imaging to make a 3-D image of Ram-Setu which helped them to see that the bridge was a 35 Km stretch that connected Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu to Mannar Island of Sri Lanka. After which they started talking about more bunch of nerdy stuff like how Setu was submerged due to global warming etc. Then the conversation turned to how they would prove Aryan's thesis right, the plan that came out was, that they needed to prove that Pushkar Bhatnagar an Indian Author and Historian, predicted Lord Rama's age to be 7000 years, so they had to prove that Ram-Setu was older than that.
That is when Naruto interrupted them, "Then Dr. Aryan, if you are collecting samples, you have to be careful, as we are very close to Lankan Waters"
Aryan nodded and agreed to the caution as they got ready for the samples on the next day.
The Next Day
In the morning, Aryan was standing on the deck getting suited up in his exosuit. Once suited up, Aryan's suit was attached to a cable.
"Alright, cable is attached, make sure it does not get tangled or it would be problematic." Naruto said.
"Will do Nakul. Now let's get some samples." Aryan said.
With that he and the team of divers dived into the Indian Ocean and with the instructions by Dr. Sandra, Naruto and Bali after a good chunk of time, they were able to retrieve a sample of coral from the structure. And it was send to a lab were Dr. Gabrielle started carbon dating of the sample and after sometime they were able to find the age of the coral sample, which was discussed in the meeting room.
"Aryan" Dr. Chandra started, "Dr. Gabrielle has carbon dated the sample you brought, and the age is more than 18 thousand years. That implies that the Ram-Setu is far much older than seven thousand years. That mean, the bridge is older than Lord Shree Ram."
"That's good, but it's not enough to substantiate our claim." Aryan countered and continued, "We need more proof, and we need to find out the age of the stones that form the main structure."
"Why do we need to find the age of the stones, we already have the ages of the coral?" Bali asked. That is when Naruto could sense some negative emotions from Bali, more akin to frustration. Aryan replied to that by saying, "Well the corals are like the paint on a wall, we need to check the age of the bricks too."
Then continued by saying, "And the brick of the Setu are the floating rocks."
Sandra countered by saying, "Impossible, In order to get to the floating rocks. We need to break the structure."
"Well," Aryan "The structure is a bit weak near this area in the gulf Mannar." He point towards a place in the map.
"Yeah we could work with that" Dr. Verma said.
"Aryan, that place dangerously close to our borders." Naruto cautioned him, while Bali was looking a bit peeved.
"Do not worry Nakul I will be careful."
That Afternoon
"Alright Aryan get ready for your second dive" Naruto said while the technicians got him in his exosuit. Then Naruto got into his own scuba gear to go with him. And then Aryan and the team of divers went in for another dive.
As they all went in for the dive, Bali, Dr. Gabrielle and Dr. Sandra were monitoring them. The team came towards a rock stuck out of the structure. They tried to take rock but it was not coming out.
"Alpha to Base, The rock is not coming out, repeat, the rock is not coming out!" Naruto reported.
"Base to Alpha, roger!"
That is when Naruto saw Aryan going towards the Lankan waters and thus warned him, "Aryan do not go further you are going into the Lankan waters." Not just him but Bali was also saying the same thing.
"Do not worry, I have seen a floating rock, it will just take a few minutes." Aryan replied.
"Aryan, I am ordering you to come back immediately!" Bali strictly ordered.
"Bali let me get the floating rock" Aryan argued. But Bali was having nothing of it so he quickly ran down towards deck and pulled on the lever to pull him back. As that was happening the divers came back on the deck and short while later the upper part of the exosuit. At the same time Naruto and the Divers came on the upper deck and Naruto asked Bali, "Where the hell is Aryan?"
To which he replied, "I was going to ask you the same damn thing!"
"Looks like he ejected himself from the exosuit" The other divers said. "Yes captain obvious, we can also see but where is Aryan?!" Naruto jeered.
Then suddenly Sandra shouted, "Guys look there!"
All the personnel on the deck looked at the general direction of where Sandra was pointing. "Is that Aryan?!" Gabrielle asked, to which both Naruto and Bali were watching through binoculars to see Aryan walking on water with a stone on his shoulder.
"What the?! Is he walking on water?!" Bali exclaims. "He is walking on Ram-Setu." Dr. Chandra said while Aryan surface on the deck, where they secured the stone. To which both Gabrielle and Chandra started discussing about the stone, "It could a pumice stone." Gabrielle said to which Chandra countered by saying, "I don't think so. Pumice Stones are made out of lava and there was no volcanic activity here in thousands of years. This is something else."
Bali and Naruto approached Aryan, and Bali admonished him, "I had told you not to enter the Lankan Waters!"
Naruto came to his defence and said, "Come on Bali give him a rest." Though he could still feel the negative emotions coming from Bali which still worried him. From the first meeting only Bali had always given him a bit of suspicious vibe but he did not act on it much as Bali had not given him a reason yet.
While both of them work conversation Aryan and the rest of the team were looking at the rock. "In Ramayana the setu was made of floating rocks so in order to disprove this theory we need to study these rocks." Aryan said as they went inside with the specimen.
Inside the started the process of carbon dating for the floating rock they found and while that was going on Naruto was there with them. Since he was the security for Aryan, he was there was there with the scientists but was not getting in between their work.
While Naruto was keeping an eye on them. Aryan was studying the features of the Setu when he was approached by Gabrielle, "Aryan, Chandra was right, this is not a pumice stone."
"Then what is it?" Aryan asked to which he got an I don't know from Gabrielle.
That was when he was approached by Sandra, "Aryan the coral samples that were brought earlier had traces of marine sand in it, which is not possible if they were not planted."
"Could it be that they floated there?"
"I don't know because then they would not look like a proper structure with smaller rocks stacked up on larger ones."
While Sandra was showing Aryan the design, Naruto peeked at it and said, "If you nerds don't mind, I would like to say something." He said.
While Aryan's face soured at the nerd comment, the jolly Sandra said, "Sure Nakul, do say."
"Well I don't know, if you guys have read the Ramayana or not but in the epic, the monkey army make the Ram Setu with stacking smaller rocks on top of bigger ones with Jai Shree Ram (Hail Lord Rama) written on it." Naruto shared. As if to support his statement, Gabrielle exclaimed, "Holy Shit! Guys you won't believe what I found."
As she had everyone's attention, she shared, "The age of the rock is roughly seven thousand years old, much younger than the organic matter found in the marine sediments."
Aryan with all the facts started to conclude the theory, "If the rock is 7000 years old and was brought during that time and as your research showed, Sandra, the structure and placement of the corals. Then the Setu is indeed man-made and was during the period of lord Rama."
This got an impressive whistle from Naruto, "Damn that's kinda cool nerds."
While ignoring Naruto's comments, Aryan approached Bali to meet him in the meeting room.
Inside the meeting hall, the whole team was present and were observing the debate between Aryan and Bali.
"So you are telling me that you want to prove that Ram Setu is a man-made structure?" Bali questioned.
"My job is to unveil the true history. Do you know what 'History' means? It thus happened. The truth will come to light."
As that was happening, the big TV in the meeting room switched on with Indrajit, the company owner joined them through a Skype call. This was the first time Naruto met this man as till now, he had only seen his picture and interviews. For some reason, Naruto always got a Gato vibe from Indrajit, whenever he looked at him.
"Good Evening team" Indrajit greeted them, getting everyone's attention.
"I got your message Aryan," he continued, "So do you think this is a man-made structure?"
"Well sir, this is what the evidence proves, Sandra and Gabrielle also agree with me." Aryan replied.
"Well, what do you think Dr. Chandra?" Indrajit asked.
"Well… I still believe that the Setu is a natural structure." Chandra replied.
"Ok, Aryan, you continue your research with Sandra and Gabrielle. Dr. Chandra, you continue working on your theory." Indrajit said, to which Aryan replied, "Thank you sir."
"No… I must thank you Aryan. Your impartiality is commendable. I suggest, to dispel all the doubts, break a section of the structure the rock was floating nearby. We need clinching proof." Indrajit said.
Aryan responded, "I agree sir, but breaking a section might invite controversy."
"Not in India" Indrajit interrupted him, "You can do whichever portion of the bridge in Sri Lanka. I have made arrangements with the Lankan government. But you will have to do this work at night, so that not too many people find out. I suggest you do it tonight."
Bali protested to this by saying, "Sir there is a civil war going on."
"Relax Bali, I know what I am doing. Give Aryan your full assistance." Indrajit calmed him down.
"Right sir."
"Thank you so much sir, thank you very much." Aryan thanked him as he ended the call.
From what Naruto and the other's could notice Bali did not like the situation at all.
It was decided that Aryan, Sandra and Gabrielle would go and find the samples in the deep waters of Sri Lanka.
Bali was looking at the underwater rover that was lowering down from his office when he was approached by one of the technicians, "Sir there is a storm approaching at 2100 hours." Said the technician.
"Are the safety checks done?"
"Yes sir they are done as per you orders."
Bali nodded and went towards the deck as he saw the rover lowering in the water. Meanwhile, in the rover Gabrielle and Sandra were watching Bali watching them.
Gabrielle whispered to Sandra, "He does not look to happy that we are doing this." To which Sandra nodded in agreement.
"That is I brought the floating rock along with me." As she shared that, Sandra exclaimed, "What?!"
This got Aryan's attention, "What are you ladies whispering?"
Sandra the said, "Gabrielle brought the floating rocks with her!" Aryan also exclaimed, "What?!"
With that exchange they went inside the waters, after sometimes Aryan notified them, "We are in Lankan waters."
As they were in Lankan waters they routed for the location of the bridge. As they approached it the driller was engaged to break a piece of the structure. After some seconds there was rapid turbulence indicating a raging storm. Sandra concerned, "I knew it was bad plan, didn't they know, a storm was coming?!"
That was when they got a overheating engine warning on their screen. "Shit!" Aryan exclaimed as their engine shut down. Meanwhile at the office Bali was getting all the transmission. He the asked his technician, "How much time do they have."
"Sir according to the oxygen levels about 2 to 5 minutes."
Meanwhile at the underwater rover there was a state of panic as Aryan opened the life jacket box to find it empty. "This was a bloody good plan, they wanted to kill us!"
Gabrielle started panicking, "I knew they wanted to kill us!" Sandra pacified her by saying, "Gabrielle shallow breaths, we have limited oxygen right, so shallow breaths."
That was when Aryan activated the jet mechanism which propelled them to the stormy water surface. Aryan first burst the gate open to come out, Sandra followed by Gabrielle and the rock then came out as Gabrielle again started panicking as a wave hit them and dropped them in the water. "I don't know how to swim!" Gabrielle panicked trying to stay afloat when she was helped by Aryan who put her on the floating rock to make her float.
As Gabrielle turned to thank him, her eyes widened, "Look-!" before she could say further a bullet lodged in her head terrifying the other two scientists. As they turned towards the direction of the shot, they saw a boat with Bali and three of his goons.
When they felt all hopes were lost suddenly another shot came from there direction killing one of the goons, when they turned they found that Naruto was the person who shot the bullet.
Then an intense firing started as Naruto produced to mini oxygen tanks and put them on the scientists and submerged them while he was firing. The first three shots were on target as the three goons were shot dead while with Bali he had to make a compromise as Bali had started shooting underwater to kill the others so he had to shoot him on the hand while drifting in the sea.
As if the rain and water gods had blessed them a fisher boat came upon them where after some struggling he put the others on the boat then climbed it himself.
As they were violently rocking on the boat the boatman introduced himself, "Myself Anjaneyan Putamaran but you can call me AP, welcome to Sri Lanka."
With that he took the three of them to a coast of the Lankan islands. Once there the three of them were sitting close to a bonfire, with a somber mood due to the recent incident. AP seeing this tried to break the ice by saying, "So, you are studying Ram-Setu right? Well, you can't study it by drowning, AP will help you, I know the Ram Setu like the back of my hand."
"How?" Naruto queried.
"Well, I used to be a tour guide before the civil war broke out, now I am making a living out of fishing in these islands."
"Please tell us what you know?" Aryan asked him.
Then AP went into the history of the bridge with led to a back and forth between the guide and the scientist. AP started by saying it was a bridge before an earthquake broke it 700 years ago to which Aryan countered by asking for proofs which AP gave by siting the historic epic Mahabharata in which Ghatotkach crosses the bridge to meet his Lankan family, and the Persian writer Alburuni who wrote about the bridge in his book Kitab-ul-hind. When asked about the scientific proofs he stated the Ramayana in which the dimension of the bridge was given to be 10:1 and the actual dimension of the bridge is 35KM in length to 3.5KM in breadth.
"That's all good but we need more proof than just an epic." Aryan said in a teasing tone which rubbed AP in a bad way so he said, "Well AP can get you to the center of the bridge, there you can get rocks even five times bigger than this and can get as many as you want. AP has resources, so be nice."
This shocked the trio. Sandra did show some hesitation but in the end Aryan's stubbornness won out and it was decided that tomorrow morning they would search for the rock. During the night Naruto volunteered to have the first watch followed by AP.
During the night Sandra joined him, "Let it out." He said to her.
"Huh?"
"You are in shock and you are terrified, let it out."
Sometimes a few words and silence can speak a lot and as if it did the magic, her tear damns broke and Naruto being Naruto, he comforted her as she cried to sleep on his lap. When AP woke up, he was amused by the situation but Naruto's glare told him to shut up as they carefully placed Sandra back at her sleeping place while Naruto also slept.
The next day, they took a boat ride to go towards the center of the bridge, as they were approaching the center, Aryan who had a binocular, from essentials bag from Naruto, spotted Bali in one of the boats, as a misfortune Bali also did the same thing, before Aryan alert could them, shots were fired at them.
Thankfully no one was hurt as Naruto quickly reloaded his gun and AP turned around the boat quickly towards the coast, the only Aryan could utter was 'Bali', which the rest of the crew understood.
As the gang reached the coast, they made a run towards the forest going deep inside it with Bali and his goons hot on their heels. As they were running deeper, shots were being exchanged between both of them, but Naruto's mags emptied faster than the opps, so they had to take cover during that chase Sandra tripped, losing them the rocked but as if a guardian angel descended from the heavens, a chopper was in front of them, with soldiers having AKs and gatling guns started firing at Bali, which they could not return so Aryan jumped in the helicopter followed by Sandra and Naruto, then as the helicopter was rising, AP took a leap, caught Naruto's hand and entered the chopper.
As he entered it, he said, "Don't worry, they AP's friends, they are the rebels fighting against the government. Meanwhile, Naruto felt a weird sensation he could not dwell on for longer as a bullet grazed his shoulder, when he turned around, he saw Bali's gun pointed at his direction.
Pushpak Alpha, few minutes after the chase
In the office, Bali was in a call with Indrajit, "Bali close of open ends while I pull some strings."
"Yes Sir"
Jaffna Rebel Camp, Sri Lanka
There was somber mood with the scientists, as they sipped on some tea in metal mug.
Aryan excused himself to go and sit on a broken tree bark at the beach facing the ocean. There he was looking at the picture of his family in his purse when he was approached by AP, who brought him a satellite phone, so that he could converse with his wife.
During the conversation, he was struck with the harrowing news that the Tamil Nadu and Kerala government had issued a joint affidavit stating that the Setu was a naturally occurring phenomenon, which was proven by scientists, that went on expedition. That was when he also had the idea of how to stop it, as the gears in his mind was turning fast when he saw a priest worshipping Ravana.
What the scientist didn't know was that the head of security's gears in the head were moving fast as he was recalling something from his past while getting bandaged.
Flashback
"… Now listen to me Naruto theory is important as if you the weakness of a certain jutsu you can counter it. In sensing you need to feel the chakra or the energy emitted by others to properly sense a threat."
"zzzzzzzz" Suddenly a chalk hit right at his forehead.
"Wake up you little tyke!"
Flashback End
He had a smile on his face recalling the fond memory with Mito. But his face turned to a frown as he thought about the implications of his thoughts. As far as he knew these humans did not have any chakra, so when he grabbed AP, he had increased charka flow in his arm and he felt a sensation that he only felt with four people, AP, Shiva, Parvati and that silver eyed beauty. That why he was on edge and thought the first moment AP would do something suspicious he would pop his head.
In the evening they all gathered around the table where Aryan asked Naruto, "Nakul, how did you find us?" Sandra was intrigued by it.
Naruto inhaled and said, "Well after your submarine went for a dive, I thought I would tail you guys, since there was no security personnel on board. So I thought I would go behind you guys in a dive suit. When I went to Bali to inform him, I overheard his plan of getting you killed which was approved by Indrajit and then the rest you know…"
"Thank you so much." Sandra said in gratitude and then said, "So what is our plan moving forward, since we lost the rock?"
"We need to prove that Ravana existed."
"What?" Sandra asked to which Naruto explained, " You going by Euclid's fourth axiom, right? If a=b and b=c then a will automatically be equal to c, so if we prove the Ravana existed then Ramayana did happen, so…"
"Yes, if we prove that Ravana existed by finding the archeological remains of Ravana's Lanka then no one would question the legitimacy of Ramayana and Ram Setu." Aryan added.
"But where would we start from, and would the Sri Lankan government support us?" Sandra let her concerns know.
"Why not? AP has connections in the government too." AP said. To which Naruto commented "Well connected". Then he continued, "Anyways, let's set some signals, Aryan, Sandra and AP if I press any part of your arm twice in a succession, that will mean that we have enemies around us and we need to make beeline out of the place. Alright?"
The guide and the scientists nodded as they went to the Jaffna Public Library, where AP had told them, they might archives of up to a thousand years worth of history.
But the trip had turned out to be pretty disappointing as Aryan could not even find any history up to even ten years there. When he made his displeasure known to the team, AP gave them a good news that the librarian had told them about the previous librarian, who taken some manuscripts and saved them at a safe place due to the civil war.
As they went out of the public library, Naruto saw a black SUV, following them, so he immediately pressed Aryan's and Sandra's arm twice then did the same with AP's too, while whispering at their ears, "Don't look back, but when I say to run, run. Let's meet at the central market here and AP you will separate from us." They nodded as they went straight.
When Naruto saw the doors of the car open, Naruto quickly said, "Run!" as an intense chase started occurring between the goons and them. The gang went into the market with the goons following them closely and sometimes shooting them. They chased them from markets to slums until they reached the Jaffna Metro station. There they straight up went in and as the reached the platform both the parties made a beeline to the metro's closing doors only for Naruto to pull the scientists back as the goons were trapped in the metro.
"Thank Me later, we have a guide to meet and a librarian to find." Naruto said as they went towards Jaffna central market to meet AP, from where they reached Jaffna fort in the evening.
There they met the librarian, who accepted to help them due to their cause and presented them the manuscript, which had documented a tunnel made by Mayasur, Ravana's father in law made, which connected Ravana's palace, Ashok Vatika and what looked like a landing place for his Pushpak Vahana. As Aryan clicked pictures of the manuscript, Naruto said, "AP which one would be closest here? We have three days before the shit goes south."
They had a discussion and decided to go to Ashok Vatika. So they took a train to Nuwara Eliya where the Ashok Vatika was situated.
During the train journey, Aryan had a realization that, Ashok Vatika was a famous tourist spot, so surely someone would have noticed the tunnels. When they searched the manuscript a better, they saw monster that resembled to a crocodile near a place which AP stated was the Ravana Falls, a waterfall where Ravana would often play his veena. They had to go there quickly not just due to the time crunch but they also had Bali on their tail.
What the four of them did not know was that Bali had already obtained the manuscript and killed the librarian and was reaching Ashok Vatika by air.
As they de-boarded their train they hitched a bus ride to the waterfall, hoping to find the tunnel. After a bus ride they rented a boat to row in the lake of Ravana falls.
While in the lake, Sandra spotted a fresh water crocodile, which were generally native of Amazon. As they started following the crocodile, they were guided towards a cave, as they started thinking that it was a bust, Naruto spotted something, "He guys I don't think the croc is on land, look at this." As all of them saw this, it was an unanimous decision to dive in the lake and enter the underwater cave. As they resurfaced, their breaths were taken away as they saw a cave filled with ancient Sinhalese writing.
Meanwhile, Bali and his team was already there at Ashok Vatika, after extensive searching, they could not find any traces of Aryan or his team.
Frustrated Bali contacted Indrajit, "Boss we could not find Aryan anywhere here. I think we need to enter the cave to find him."
"Don't we have three days, do not make haste, find someone who can decipher the manuscript and who can think like Aryan."
"Don't worry sir I have just the person in my mind."
Meanwhile Aryan went to work while AP and Naruto lit a fire torch and pointed it at the cave wall, which had writings which Aryan deciphered as ancient Sinhalese script called Hala script. So, they started clicking pictures of it while, when Aryan was going to decipher in Naruto interrupted him by saying, "Nerds decipher it later we have to caves here. One has the weird writings while other does not and by the wind flow both of them connect at a point so let's make two teams and choose a tunnel." After a bit of discussion, it was decided that Naruto and AP will go with the scripless tunnel while Aryan and Sandra will go in the tunnel with Hala script on it and would document it.
As both of them entered the tunnel Naruto's plan was activated, during the discussion Naruto applied a subtle genjutsu on Aryan and Sandra which will counteract the genjutsu he felt on the cave they wanted to enter so, they could safely reach the main tunnels, while him and AP went into the tunnel which will become a maze that would not take them to their destination. Inside their cave Naruto pumped some Kyuubi's chakra into his hand and started the plan he formed in the rebel camp.
He suddenly attacks shocked AP but he still defended himself with equal amount of force. Then in a menacing way he said, "So you have revealed yourself huh, jinchuuriki?" Then he produces a mace from thin air and swings it producing a huge gust of air, while Naruto counteracts it by forming the dog hand sign and blows air from his mouth, "Wind Style: Beast Vacuum Wave." As both the attacks collide, both of them are thrown in the opposite direction. As Naruto shook of the fall, he immediately formed the hand signs for 'Earth Style: Spike Pit'. AP narrowly dodged that and then both of them went into melee combat until they were exhausted then AP pantingly said, "So should we talk?" And Naruto nodded as both of them sat on the ground.
"So how did you know, I was a Jinchuuriki?" Naruto asked.
"Um like everyone knows, Lord Shiva and Lady Parvati are your neighbors so all of them monitor you and the girl." AP replied, this shattered Naruto's view about his kind neighbors, while seething inside he kept a calm face and asked, "So, you Hanuman, right?"
"What gave it away?"
"A lot of things like your name, Anjaneyan Putamaran roughly translating to Anjali Putra (Son of Anjali), and let's not forget about the jump." They both chuckled at that and they Naruto suggested, "So let's go meet up with our nerds, shall we?" Both of them nodded as they met up with the scientists. There they found the three tunnels out that one of them was block, the only places left were Sri Poda and Wariyapola, Ravana's Airport. After some argument, they chose Sri Poda.
As they exited the tunnels, they were greeted by a mountain top as Sri Poda was also called Trikuta, a place on the Trikut Mountain. As they went down the mountain, they saw the triangular shadow of the mountain, which they theorized that the tip of the shadow was Ravana's Lanka. As they wandered a bit more they founded something that would prove their claim, it was a land of selaginella bryopteris.
Sandra ran and identified the plant and then she also said something that made Aryan immensely happy, "It is the Sanjeeveni Booti in Ramayana." And then it all fell in place and as to piss on their triumph moment, someone popped up in a helicopter.
As the wind started to pick up in the field, they looked up to see a helicopter hovering over them and in that helicopter was Aryan's wife Gayatri. As he saw her, his smiled but immediately frowned as Bali popped up from the other side of the door. "What's up fellas! Long time no see."
Naruto uttered only one word, "Fuck"
They had to comply with Bali and were now in the Helicopter, "Aryan, I am very sorry, but he scared me." Gayatri apologized. Before anyone could saw anything AP stood up to negotiate with him. As he stood up Bali backhanded him, making him fall of the Helicopter. The only thing Aryan could grab on him was his bag. Enraged, Aryan backhanded him, knocking him into the front seat and knocking him out.
As he did that, Naruto squared the jaw of his teammate and knocked him and then he found the emergency parachutes and said, "You guys jump, I will follow you guys." Before Sandra could protest, he shouted at her to jump and then pushed her. As the rest of them left, Bali woke up and engaged him in hand to hand combat, which resulted in Naruto demolishing him completely as a result, Bali was knocked out while his goons were killed. And then Naruto jumped from the chopper and joined the crew while the helicopter crashed.
As the helicopter blasted with killing Bali with it, the team breathed a sigh of relief.
"How do we leave?" Aryan asked to specifically nobody.
"Well, A.P. did say he had private plane near." Naruto said while they search for plane. After some searching around, they found the plane. "So does anyone know how to fly a plane?"
"I know" Naruto raised his hand and then Aryan said, "So Nakul where to?"
"Sion Fort" Naruto replied. "Why?"
"Jackass we need to have the director's signature on the stones carbon dating to make it as evidence to be presented in the Supreme Court. You cannot give a preachy speech there like movies and think it would work." Naruto said, "You have a day, today we get the signatures and the requisite documents and submit it in the court, and let the lawyers do their job."
"How do you know so much?" Aryan asked,
"Well along with being a wing commander I do have a BALLB degree so let's go."
After the day's event, one could see Naruto on the plane from Delhi to Kolkata while reading the newspaper, where an article read, 'THE SUPREME COURT SHELVES THE SETUSAMUDRAM PROJECT FOR INFINITE HAITUS'
West Bengal, India
After the whole Ram-Setu fiasco and the things that were revealed to him, Naruto was pissed and he needed answers. As lady luck would have him, they would have lunch at their neighbors. So Naruto was ready for anything. He took some level 80 suppressor seals which were enough to suppress the power output of 10 Kyuubi's, so a god would be nothing for him. With that in mind, he went to the Das's House.
As they entered the house his resolve slowly started to shake up seeing Parvati's excited face as for him they slowly became a real family and it was hard to confront them. Parvati hugged him excitedly and then started to rapid-fire questions about the expedition and everything, to which he started answering questions one by one, and then he was given the same treatment by Shrishti. His resolve now seriously started to falter as getting love-bombed like this. He did not know how would he confront them.
As the lunch commenced, he ate slowly, thinking about how to go about the matter, at first he thought to delicately approach it but then he remembered his name and decided to wing it like he did with Hanuman [Hey it worked once, it will work again!]. So, after lunch was finished, he decided to strike.
"Hey Shivansh, could we speak it privately." Naruto asked him and Shivansh nodded and said, "Sure, let's go upstairs." With that, the two boys left.
Once they were upstairs they entered Shivansh's office and once they were inside, Naruto deployed both the suppressor seals and the privacy seals and then quietly closed the door. Then moved towards his desk while saying, "So Naruto what did you want to discuss in pri-" He stopped saying as his eyes widened when he looked back to see a red bubbly coated fist reaching towards him.
Knowing there was no other way out of it, as his human body could not handle the strike, so he powered up his godly powers to stop the fist. It did burn him a little since he did not use all of his power. As he stopped the fist, he looked to see his assailant.
What he saw was, Naruto with a deranged grin, his eyes turned red with slit pupils, and his hand covered in a red bubbly aura.
"Naruto!" He said in a shocked voice.
"So you finally showed your real self, Shivansh, or should I say Lord Shiva," Naruto says.
Shiva's eyes widened as he jumped up when a blade of wind passed under him which sliced his chair. Shiva pleaded with him, "Naruto stop this madness!"
"Oh, I will stop when you show me your color!"
This pissed Shiva off, "Oh you want to see power. I will show you POWER." With that Shiva gathered some of his godly power and punched him on his face. Naruto not being one to give up, gathered some more of his Kyuubi's chakra, concentrated in hand, and punched him square on his face. This quickly scaled into a phone booth fight as both of them powered up and punched each other.
It went to a point where Shiva had lower god power, while Naruto went three-tails mode and both concentrated their powers in their hands and went for final punches, that was when both of them felt someone kicking them on their back and putting them in a chokehold and flipped them as Naruto landed into the door while Shiva was knocked towards the table.
Both of them shrugged their disorientation to see an angry Parvati with a trident in her hand. "Durga!" Naruto's eyes widened at their form.
"BOTH OF YOU BOYS CALM DOWN NOW!" She raged.
Flashback (A Few Minutes earlier)
As both of the boys left, Parvati and Shrishti were left on the ground floor and kitchen. Parvati could see that she was glowing with happiness. Then she felt the house tremble, at first she thought it was a normal earthquake but then she felt the house shake again and now she knew it was intentional. After that, she felt a Demonic power and Godly power.
She knew her husband was the god of destruction, thus she knew that kind of energy but it was different, it was demonic. So, when she saw the boys fighting, she knew something had triggered them, and when she heard them while fighting she concluded that Naruto knew about their charade, and when she saw them approaching for a kill shot. She had seen enough thus she interrupted.
Present Time
Both of them saw Parvati in her Durga form and had only one thought, "I am fucked!"
She quietly went over to both of them pulled out three chairs and then commanded then, "Sit!" And both of the grown men looked like admonished children as they sat on the chair. Then she said, "I would not have two grown men fight like children, now tell me your grievances and sort it out like adults! Naruto, you go first. And I want to be civil"
"OK di, for your sake I am willing to be civil."
"Shiva"
"Fine me too dear."
"Good, now Naruto speak."
"OK, I attacked him to prove my theory about him being a god."
"How did you find out?" Parvati asked.
"A certain monkey with a brunt tail revealed to me."
"I am going to kill that monkey!" Shiva mentally raged.
"So Naruto what do want to know, now that you know the truth?"
"I want to know why the fuck are you guys here. I don't think that god-like you want to come in a polluted shithole like this place for fun."
Parvati deadpanned at him while asking, "Is it necessary to curse?"
"I cuss when I am angry and anxious." Naruto equally deadpanned
"Alright. Shiva, tell him the truth." Parvati said.
"Dear, is it necessary to tell him?" Shiva countered.
"Shiva now," Parvati ordered.
"Ugh Fine." Shiva groaned and then spilled out the truth, about the prophecy and everything. While Shiva was spilling the beans, Naruto was getting pissed off by the second and after he finished speaking Naruto was internally seething.
"So you are telling me, you see the future?" Naruto asked.
"Yes."
"Then Motherfucker, why didn't you save her?!" Naruto finally burst, "You dickhead, if you could see the future, why in the FUCK didn't you stop the killing. Motherfucker if you did…. I would have still killed the fucker and his bitch wife." As he said that he went to grab his collar but was restrained by Parvati.
"I can see but I cannot stop."
"English Fucker!"
"Look we gods can possible future but we cannot meddle in human affairs, though demigod is different."
"Elaborate."
"Look the only thing we do not have control over is birth and death so even if I could predict it I cannot meddle with them."
"Fine, but why are you here and how the fuck did you know I was here cuz you came about nine months after I was here. So spill!"
Parvati was also intrigued by this question, as she also didn't known about Naruto before, almost three years now. So she looked at Shiva expecting answers. Shiva looked at them, knowing that he was backed into a corner, so he spilled the beans, "Alright, I will tell you the truth, but while I will be talking, please be quiet and have an open mind." Both of them nodded.
"Alright, this story starts 16 years ago, 10th October 1972." Hearing the date and year, Naruto's eyes widen. Shiva looked at him and nodded, then continued, "Brahma, Vishnu, and I were having a meeting with the Shinto heads, Amaterasu, Susano, Tsukuyomi, and Shinigami about something, we were having an agreement about a certain situation, when Shinigami was suddenly summoned. He checked why was he summoned, and saw that he was summoned in the veil. He was asked to seal one of the tailed beasts inside an infant."
Parvati's face had horror written all over it as she heard the tale, but Shiva continued, "I was intrigued by that boy, interested in what path he would choose. A boy, who never asked for such power, yet bore the consequences for it. I wanted to know, if would he turn into a mindless killing machine or a homicidal monster but he always cared about others' well-being, a selfless warrior. So, when he tried to escape I gave him a hand by order Varun to guide and save him while he was abandoned in the sea. His name is -"
"-Naruto Fucking Uzumaki" Naruto completed for him. Parvati was shocked but Shiva said, "When I again saw you in your early teens, I always thought you had so much good to do in this world, so I played a gamble and bet on you. Guess I was right."
Naruto was semi-emotional hearing that, "Thanks, look I am sorry for how it went but some old cronies with shit for brains gave me a lot of trust issues so…"
Shiva nodded in acceptance, "I get it."
"Anyways I wanted to ask something." Naruto said and Shiva nodded giving him the green light he continued by asking, "Why is Shrishti so special, who is she really?"
Shiva was taken aback by the question and counter-questioned him, "What do you mean?"
"What I mean is, who is she, or better yet what is she? I mean at first, you guided grandma to me. At first, I thought it was random but then I met my sister who has survived a point-blank bomb blast by some fucking miracle, so either she is the female version of Johnny Storm or something that I don't know about, so spill, and if you say she is a mutant, I will punch your nose till it fucking breaks."
Shiva sighed and said, "Ok, well this might take time."
"Give a short explanation."
"Do you know what Brahmastra is?"
"Yes, the world-ending destructive weapon."
"Yes, well that is real."
"Well fuck so what of it?"
"Well when the Brahmastra is real, but to counter it we also made another thing. We made elemental weapons and blessed them to people who were worthy of it. There were about 40 out of which 13 were more powerful than the others. Then one day, there was a person who could harness the Brahmastra in its entire entity. So the weapon bearers finished him and sealed the Brahmastra."
Naruto getting the whole gist of the story concluded, "So you are telling me that Shrishti is a weapon bearer?"
"Yes, she is the fire elemental weapon bearer."
Naruto took a deep breath and said, "So is there a way to train that power?"
"Yes, we have an institute cum hostel in Himachal Pradesh, so that people of all ages could be trained there."
"Alright. But Parvati Di is Shrishti…."
"Don't worry I knocked her out before our conversation." "Good"
With that all of them went down and acted like nothing had happened, not knowing that in the middle-east there was a storm brewing.
Teheran, Iran
In the capital city of Iran, Teheran, there is a mansion. A mansion which is filled with festivities, as the owner of the mansion was getting married. As the ladies chatted in one room, the men danced to the song 'Jamal Jamalu' in the other room. The groom, who was a Middle eastern-caucasian man, had curly hair and a thick beard, holding a glass of alcohol and cigarette in both of his hands and dancing to the melody of the song. That is when another skinny man with long hair and no beard came in with his arms wide open, "Brother!" He warmly greeted the man with a hug, "Congratulations on the wedding!" He said.
"Thank you." The groom said.
"Hey no thank you today. Today is your day. Today is Abrar Haq's day!"
"Thank you very Abid," Abrar said in gratitude.
"It's nothing now where are the other three?"
"Ruksana hasn't picked up her phone, Aziz said he is a bit busy but will come to the reception and Asrar is coming" Abrar replied to the question, then another man entered the room, he was a well-built man, he hugged Abrar and said,
"Congratulations, Abrar or should I say, Dr. Abhijit Katta." All three brothers laughed as Abid remarked, "It's good that the old hag is dead. Now all that is left is the defenseless little girl. Anyways it's time." With that, the three brothers left not knowing that the defenseless little girl was going to get an amazing buff.
Elemental Nations, Konohagakure, Sarutobi House
While others were cheering, Shikamaru was in deep thought, he was contemplating about confronting Naruto. He knew that Naruto was the dangerous one between Sasuke and Naruto. Unlike Sasuke, who was pampered, had a family, and had a track mind about revenge. While Naruto on the other hand had to struggle all his life, Shikamaru had seen it. He knew Naruto lived in the red light district, and everyone ostracized him. But Naruto always smiled through it. Then he learned about Naruto learning the shadow clone jutsu and Rasengan at first he dismissed the time he took to learn the Justus but when he saw them for himself he had respect for the blond. Also, he saw him summoning a giant toad and defeating Gaara. He knew about one thing about Naruto he could adapt to any situation and was extremely lucky. So, one thing he knew was that Naruto might be much stronger than any of them, they had to go for the maiming. Shikamaru sighed and he thought, "Troublesome Blondes".
END OF LONG FLASHBACK
Naruto woke up due to the landing turbulence of the landing. He woke up and spoke to himself, "Damn, it's been a while I thought about that." He then turned to see that his children were sleeping soundly, regardless of the turbulence. Naruto gently shook both his children, as they squirmed and woke up. Vassilis yawned and asked, "Dad, have we reached?"
"No son, we are right now in London, where we will spend an hour and then we will meet Mama, alright?" He explained to both his children, as both the kids brightened up and scampered out of the plane and ran on the jet bridge, while Naruto hollered, "Kids! No running!"
As they waited in the international terminal of the London Heathrow Airport where a disguised clone was watching the children while Naruto called Artemis,
"Hello," Artemis said as she picked up the call.
"Hey, hon are you busy right now?"
"No, I am not, why?"
"Nothing, anyways, we have reached Heathrow, and in 13 hours, maybe after the kids fall asleep…"
"You men are all the same." Naruto could feel her shaking her head.
"Hey you didn't complain before, I still remember you scre-"
"Shut up! You know what? You are getting the couch for a week!"
"Hey, I was just kidding, " he said in cold sweat.
"You better mister! Now what really happened?"
"What do you mean?"
"We have been married for a good six years. So I know that Mr. Uzumaki doesn't call his missus unless something has been plaguing his mind, so spill. "
Knowing he could not get around his stubborn woman, he spilled, "Arty I am worried, I don't know how much I can protect them or how much I can deflect them, I just don't know."
"Sweetie, you do not have to do it on your own, I am there too. Remember what you said to me once, you and me, we are a team, and we will go through this together, alright?"
"Yeah love you"
"Love you too babe." With that, he cut the call since the boarding had started and he was ready to meet his wife after a long time.

Artemis ended the call and slipped the phone into her pocket. She had excused herself from her hunters to take it, stepping away into the quiet of the surrounding trees. Now, alone for a moment, she leaned against the rough bark of an ancient oak.
As the silence settled around her, her mind began to drift back through the years, how everything went from worst to worse to bad to good to bad to best to worse to now again best. She felt nostalgic as she thought about it.
THIS WILL BE THE START OF A LONG FLASHBACK SO NO ITALICS ARE USED, THOUGH MAY BE USED FOR FLASHBACK IN A FLASHBACK
16 years ago, USA...
The rain was a violation. It was not the gentle mist of a sacred grove or the brisk shower of a mountain peak; it was a cold, urban deluge that plastered the thin fabric of her chiton to a body that felt terrifyingly fragile. Each drop was a hammer blow against skin suddenly too thin, too vulnerable.
Artemis stood, a small, drenched statue of misery on the rain-slicked sidewalk. The colossal shadow of the Empire State Building loomed behind her, a tombstone marking the grave of her divinity. The disbelief, a cold, hard stone in her gut, began to crack, and from the fissures seeped a poison so potent it burned.
Hatred.
Her head tilted up, a slow, deliberate motion against the weight of the rain. Through the watery veil, she glared at the hidden peak of Olympus. A silent snarl twisted her eight-year-old features, making them ancient and terrible.
Let your thrones rot.The curse formed in her mind, a venomous litany against every single one of them.Let your ambrosia turn to ash.Her thoughts spared no one—not wise Athena, whose logic was a sharper knife than any blade, not warm Hestia, whose hearth's comfort was revealed to be the cruellest lie of all.
A shiver—a violent, humiliating tremor she could not control—wracked her small frame. It hammered the finality of her fate into her bones. She was banished. Stripped. Alone. The crumpled note from Apollo in her numb hand was a pathetic mockery of an anchor. She was adrift in a world of men she despised, her godhood a fading echo, the cold reality of her mortality a shackle she could not break.
The rain had settled into a miserable, persistent drizzle, soaking the world in a patina of grey. Every sound was an assault—the hiss of tires on wet asphalt, the jarring blare of a distant horn, the cacophony of human voices raised in argument or laughter. It was all so… loud. So, crude. To Artemis, whose senses had been attuned to the whisper of the wind through leaves and the soft footfall of a deer, it was a form of torture.
A new, gnawing emptiness growled in her stomach, a demand so base and mortal it filled her with fresh shame. Her fingers, small and chilled to the bone, fumbled in the simple pocket of her damp chiton. They closed around a thin, crumpled wad of paper. For a heart-clenching moment, she feared it was the address, that she had already lost her only tether to this alien world. But no. She pulled it out.
It was money. Human currency. Ten crumpled ten-dollar bills. A hundred dollars. A fortune to a mortal, she supposed, but to her, it was a final, insulting symbol of her fall. This was what her eternal existence had been traded for. A few pieces of green paper that felt cheap and flimsy between her fingers. She stared at it, the image of Zeus's cold, dismissive gaze flashing in her mind. Had he personally counted this out? Had it been part of the decree? 'The goddess Artemis is hereby stripped of her divinity and shall be cast out with… one hundred dollars.' The pettiness of it was breathtaking.
With a shuddering breath that fogged in the chilled air, she shoved the money back into her pocket, her movements stiff and uncoordinated in her new, weaker body. Her other hand still clutched the note from Apollo. She had expected a mocking verse, a final jab to underscore her humiliation. She unfolded it with a sense of dread, her childish fingers struggling with the wet paper.
The message inside was stark in its simplicity. No words of comfort, no explanation, no poetic farewell. Just an address:128 Myrtle Avenue, Woodbury, New Jersey.
A destination. A set of coordinates in a world she no longer understood. Was this her brother's idea of a cruel joke? A place that didn't exist? Or was it… something else? A tiny, treacherous spark of hope tried to ignite within her chest, and she ruthlessly smothered it. Hope was for fools and mortals. She was now the latter, but she refused to be the former.
Her eyes, once silver and sharp enough to track a sparrow in a gale from across a continent, now scanned the confusing urban landscape with hopeless confusion. A bus stop. She needed to find a bus stop. Following signs, she barely understood, her small, sandaled feet splashing through cold puddles that seeped into her footwear, she finally found a sheltered bench.
She sat, her posture defeated, her body language screaming of a profound and total loss. She drew her knees up to her chest, a futile attempt to conserve warmth and appear smaller, invisible. The wait was an eternity filled with the discomfort of the hard plastic seat and the unsettling feeling of mortal eyes glancing her way. A woman offered a sympathetic smile. Artemis glared back with a venom that made the woman quickly look away. Pity. She was now an object of pity.
A bus rumbled to a stop, its destination scrolls reading a name she didn't recognize. "New Jersey?" she asked the driver, her voice small and unused, lacking its former divine command.
"Transfer at Port Authority, kid," the man grunted, not unkindly.
She paid with one of the strange bills, receiving alien coins in return, and found a seat by a fogged-up window. As the bus pulled away from the curb, carrying her further from the only home she had ever known, the full weight of her circumstance crashed down upon her. She was no longer a goddess who saw humans as inferior beings. She was one of them. Helpless, cold, and utterly alone, with nothing to her name but a handful of paper and a scrap of hope she didn't want to trust. Her only prayer was that the address, the one concrete thing she possessed, was a genuine kindness from the brother who had stood alone in her defence, and not the final twist of the knife. Now all she could do was sit for the hour-long ride with only thinking about where it all went wrong.
She sat on the window seat on the left aisle looking at the city as she was leaving it behind, not noticing the old lady that sat beside her. Thinking about her banishment she pictured it.
Flashback: 2 Days Ago…
New York
Jonathan Stone was, by all mortal accounts, a paragon. A decorated fire captain from Queens, he was a local hero famous for running into burning buildings long after his colleagues were ordered to evacuate. His minor philanthropy—donating time and money to children's hospitals and veterans' charities—was done without press conferences or plaques, fuelled by a genuine, unassuming desire to do good. But the source of his near-supernatural luck and strength was a secret buried in his bloodline: he was a legacy of Zeus.
If asked, Jonathan would never claim divine favour. With a humble shrug, he'd simply say his great-grandfather watched over him. His family was a dynasty of service, with veterans stretching from the beaches of Normandy to the jungles of Vietnam, a fact that filled Zeus with a pride he rarely felt for his modern children. In the constant, silent rivalry between the Brothers Three, Jonathan was Zeus's ultimate ace. While Poseidon could claim the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and Hades the genocidal dictator Adolf Hitler among their diluted descendants, Zeus could point to Jonathan Stone—a good man, a family man, a hero. He was living, breathing proof of Zeus's superior lineage.
Their bond transcended the typical god-legacy dynamic. One stormy night, moved by Jonathan's unwavering courage in the face of a collapsing warehouse fire, Zeus appeared before him, not as a distant ancestor, but in a crackle of ozone and a flash of brilliant white light. "Ask of me any blessing," the king of the gods had boomed, his voice like thunder. "Wealth, power, immortality. It is yours."
The mortal's response stunned him into a rare, profound silence. Jonathan didn't ask for anything for himself. He asked for good health and a long life for his infant son and daughter, and a happy, stable marriage for his wife, Clara. The sheer selflessness of it, so alien to the narcissistic world of Olympus, humbled Zeus. From that moment, Jonathan became more than a legacy; he became a son. A son Zeus could be proud of.
Zeus became a frequent, invisible guest in their modest home, a spectral grandfather watching children's birthday parties and a confidant sharing a glass of ambrosia-laced whiskey with Jonathan after a long day. He told him everything—the glorious, the petty, the shameful. He spoke of his fears, his frustrations with the other gods, and his countless infidelities. The Stone family, with their profound and simple morality, never judged him. They offered a forgiveness and unconditional love Hera never could.
The only rift in their relationship came with the revelation of the affair with Beryl Grace. Jonathan, whose own childhood had been shattered by his father's adultery, was fiercely disappointed. He didn't yell or preach; his quiet disapproval, the sad shake of his head, was a more potent punishment than any lightning bolt. It took time, patience, and a demonstrated effort from Zeus to earn back his trust, a scar that remained but ultimately healed.
For Zeus, Jonathan was everything: a son, his closest confidant, his anchor to the best parts of mortality, and his personal therapist. For Jonathan, Zeus was the difficult, flawed, but ultimately loving father he'd never had. And for his children, he was just Grandpa Z, who told fantastic stories and made the lights flicker when he laughed.
A Forest near New York
The forest was a cathedral of ancient oak and dappled sunlight, a sacred space where the only sounds were the rustle of leaves and the distant, silver laughter of a stream. For Elara, a young hunter of Artemis barely two decades into her immortal service, it was a place of perfect peace. She had been tracking a magnificent stag for three days, not for the kill, but for the honor of the hunt, to observe its grace and power. Now, miles from her sisters, she had paused by the stream to refill her waterskin, her bow leaning against a mossy log.
The first sign of the intrusion was the smell—acrid, unnatural. Smoke. Then came the sound, a low, hungry crackle that was utterly foreign to the serene melody of the woods. Her head snapped up, her senses, honed by her goddess's blessing, stretching out. A fire. And it was moving fast.
Driven by a duty deeper than command, Elara abandoned her hunt and ran toward the threat. She crested a ridge and her blood ran cold. A wall of flame, fanned by a sudden, mischievous wind, was racing through the dry undergrowth toward a secluded cluster of homes on the forest's edge. Panic, raw and human, threaded through her divine calm. Mortals were in danger.
She was not a goddess who could command the winds or summon rain. She was a hunter. Her first instinct was to run, to find her Lieutenant, to rally the hunters to help evacuate and contain. But as she turned, a thunderouscrackechoed over the roar of the flames. A giant old pine, its heart eaten by the fire, groaned and began its deadly fall—directly toward a small, wooden playhouse in the backyard of the nearest home.
Without a second thought, Elara ran. Not away, but toward the falling tree. She moved with preternatural speed, a blur of silver and brown, leaping over a collapsing fence. She couldn't stop the tree, but she could save whoever was inside. She slammed into the playhouse door just as the shadow of the falling giant enveloped her, using all her enhanced strength to shove the small figure huddled inside—a young mortal girl, no more than five—clear of the structure.
There was a splintering, deafening crash. A searing pain exploded in her leg as a branch from the falling tree pinned her to the scorched earth. The world narrowed to the smell of sap and smoke, the weight of the timber, and the terrified sobs of the little girl she had saved, who was now screaming for help.
It was into this hellscape that Jonathan Stone arrived. He wasn't supposed to be home; his shift at the firehouse had ended an hour ago. He'd been reading to his own children when the smoke had billowed past the window. While others fled, he ran toward the danger, his father's—hisgrandfather's—courage thrumming in his veins. He'd been helping an elderly neighbour when he saw the tree fall and heard the child's scream.
He found Elara first. A young woman, dressed in strange, archaic hunting leathers, trapped under a monstrous branch. Her face was a mask of pain and startling determination, her hands bloody from trying to free herself. And beside her, his neighbour's daughter, Mia, sobbing and clutching the hunter's tunic.
"It's okay! I've got you! I'm a firefighter!" Jonathan yelled, his voice a steady anchor in the chaos. He didn't see a divine being; he saw an injured young woman who had clearly tried to save a child.
He strained against the branch, his legacy-given strength making the impossible merely difficult. With a grunt of effort, he lifted the weight just enough. "Pull your leg out! Now!"
Elara, dizzy with pain and disoriented, obeyed. The moment she was free, Jonathan dropped the branch with a ground-shaking thud. He didn't hesitate. Seeing the deep, ugly gash on her leg and the way she couldn't put weight on it, he made a split-second decision. He swept her up into his arms in a bridal carry, grabbing the crying Mia with a firm, reassuring hold against his side.
"I've got you both," he promised, his voice calm and certain.
To Mia, he was a hero. To Elara, in her pain-fogged state, his actions were a terrifying violation. Amanwas touching her. A man was carrying her. The sacred oath screamed in her mind. She struggled weakly. "Unhand me! Do not touch me!"
"It's okay, you're safe," Jonathan insisted, mistaking her divine fury for panic. He carried them both through the swirling smoke, away from the advancing flames, and deposited them gently onto the soft grass of a safe yard two properties over, surrounded by other evacuated families.
"My leg… it will heal," Elara gasped, pushing against his chest, her eyes wide with a fear he completely misread. "Leave me!"
"It's a bad cut, you need a tourniquet," Jonathan said, his voice full of genuine concern. Thinking only to stop the bleeding, he quickly stripped off his belt. Before Elara could process his intent, he knelt and wrapped the leather belt tightly around her thigh, above the wound, pulling it firm to stanch the flow of blood.
It was an act of pure, practical kindness. But to Elara, the feeling of the man's hands on her bare leg, the possessive circle of his belt around her thigh, was the ultimate defilement. She saw not a lifesaving measure, but a claim, a branding.
Satisfied she was no longer bleeding out, Jonathan gave her a reassuring smile. "Medics are coming. You're going to be fine." Then he turned and ran back toward the fire, toward others who needed help, a hero to the last.
Meanwhile, from the tree line, shrouded in smoke, Lysandra, a veteran hunter with centuries of bitterness etched into her soul, had seen it all. She had arrived just in time to see the massive man scoop up her wounded sister. She saw him carry her off. She saw him kneel between her legs. She saw him bind her with his belt. She did not see the context of the rescue, the child, or the kindness in his eyes. She saw only a narrative of violation, a mortal man abducting and claiming one of their own.
Her face hardened into a mask of cold fury. As the first sirens wailed in the distance, she melted back into the forest, her mission changed. She had to report to the Goddess. Immediately.
The sacred grove was a place of stillness, where moonlight fell in liquid silver through the canopy. Artemis stood by a reflecting pool, her mind touching the consciousness of a wolf pack miles away. The connection shattered as Lysandra, a veteran hunter with centuries of service etched into her stern face, burst into the clearing. Her armour was smudged with soot, and her breath came in sharp gasps, but it was the cold, controlled fury in her eyes that made Artemis snap to attention.
"My Lady," Lysandra stated, going to one knee, her voice tight. "An incident. A potential violation."
Artemis's face became a mask of icy calm. "Rise. Report everything you saw. Omit nothing."
Lysandra stood, her gaze direct. She was a faithful servant, not a schemer. She reported the facts as her eyes had recorded them.
"I was tracking Elara's trail near the mortal settlement of Woodbury. I smelled smoke. A wildfire, moving fast. I found her near the blaze. She had just saved a mortal child from a falling tree. She was brave. The tree fell; a branch pinned her. She was injured. Gravely."
Artemis's hands clenched at her sides, but she remained silent, listening.
"Then a mortal male arrived. Large. Powerful. He moved the branch that pinned her with significant strength. He did not flee the fire. He approached them." Lysandra's voice was flat, factual. "He lifted Elara into his arms. She struggled against him. She was clearly distressed and called out for him to release her. He did not. He also picked up the child and carried them both away from the immediate danger."
Lysandra paused, her lips thinning. "He took them to a yard a safe distance away. Then… he knelt. He put his hands on her. He removed his belt and bound it tightly around her upper thigh. She was struggling throughout this. Once he was finished, he left her there and returned to the fire."
She finished her report. "I retrieved Elara immediately after he departed. She is in the healing springs. The physical wound is deep, but she is shaken more by the… encounter. That is all I witnessed."
Lysandra had reported the truth. But she had also reported it through the lens of a thousand years of hating and distrusting mankind. She had seen a man carry off a struggling, wounded hunter. She had seen him hold her down and bind her with his belt. The context of rescue, the medical necessity, the kindness in Jonathan's eyes—these were invisible to her. She reported the action, and the action alone, looked exactly like a brutal claim of ownership.
Artemis did not ask for context. The image Lysandra's words painted was all she needed. A man. Touching one of her maidens. Handling her. Forcing . The sacred oath screamed in her ears, drowning out any voice of reason. Her vision tinted with a red haze of pure, undiluted rage.
"Describe him," Artemis commanded, her voice dangerously low, a whisper of death.
"Broad-shouldered. Dark hair. He moved with the confidence of a warrior. He wore a symbol on a chain around his neck—a bronze eagle."
It was enough. For a goddess, it was more than enough.
A moment later, Artemis stood on a wind-scoured cliff overlooking the town of Woodbury. The smoke from the fire still stained the horizon. Her divine senses, sharper than any bloodhound's, sought the unique signature of the man who had dared lay hands on her hunter. She found it—a spark of unusual vitality, a trace of ozone that was familiar and now utterly offensive.
She found Jonathan Stone outside the town hospital. He was covered in soot and sweat, giving a statement to a paramedic, waving off attention for a minor burn on his own arm. "I'm fine, really. Check on the crew in Engine 4," he was saying, his voice warm with concern for others.
He never saw her coming.
Artemis did not announce herself. She did not demand an explanation. In her heart, the evidence was irrefutable. She became the vengeance of every woman wronged by a man.
As Jonathan turned to walk toward his truck, exhausted but satisfied, the cliff face above the parking lot shuddered. With a subtle twitch of her divine will, Artemis loosened a single, massive boulder. It wasn't a blast of lightning; it was a terrible, plausible accident.
The rock tore free with a grinding roar. Jonathan looked up, his eyes widening not with fear, but with a final, fleeting moment of calculation. There was no time to run. It struck the ground before him with cataclysmic force, and a shard of stone, sharp as a spear, shot out from the impact.
It struck him through the heart.
He was dead before he hit the ground, his body crushed and broken by the seemingly random act of nature. A tragic end for a hero. A perfect accident.
Artemis watched, her fury cooling into grim satisfaction. Justice was served.
Miles away, on Olympus, Zeus was in his private chambers, holding a simple, hand-drawn birthday card from a little girl named Mia. He smiled. The smile vanished.
A searing, psychic pain lanced through him, followed by a void, a sudden, deafening silence where there had always been a vibrant, familiar presence. It was a feeling he had not felt in millennia, not since the fall of a favoured hero. The amulet he had given Jonathan—and matching ones to Clara and the children—was more than jewellery. It was a tether, a silent alarm for family.
The connection had snapped.
The card fluttered from his suddenly numb fingers. The air in the room crackled, and the scent of ozone became overpowering. His eyes, which moments before had been twinkling with grandfatherly pride, now swirled with the chaos of a nascent storm.
Something had happened to Jonathan.
And the King of the Gods would tear the world apart to find out what.
The air crackled, thick with the promise of a storm that had not been on any mortal forecast. A flash of light, blinding and absolute, illuminated the hospital parking lot for a single, searing instant. Where it faded, Zeus stood, his massive form seeming to suck the sound from the world.
His eyes, wide with divine panic, scanned the chaos until they found the epicentre of his pain. There, amidst the dust and rubble, lay Jonathan. Not the vibrant, laughing son of his heart, but a broken doll of a man, his life bleeding out onto the cold asphalt. A sound ripped from Zeus's throat, something between a roar and a sob, as he fell to his knees beside him, ignoring the terrified screams of mortals who scattered like leaves.
He cradled Jonathan's head, his hands, which could command lightning, now trembling. "My boy," he whispered, his voice thick. "Who did this? Speak to me."
Jonathan's eyes fluttered open, their focus swimming. He didn't see the King of Olympus. He saw a father. A final, rattling breath escaped his lips, a whisper meant only for one set of ears. "Hey pops… please… take care of… Clara… the kids…and…thank you…for being…my dad."
The light in his eyes faded. The tether, the one Zeus had felt snap from a world away, was now a frayed and silent end. Jonathan Stone was gone.
An agony unlike any he had known in centuries seized Zeus. A single, hot tear traced a path through the dust on his godly cheek. It hit the ground, and the sky above them exploded. Rain fell not in drops, but in sheets, a torrential, punishing downpour that mirrored his grief.
As he held the body of the man he loved as a son, his divine gaze, sharpened by unimaginable pain, swept the area. He was looking for a reason, for a weapon, for any clue. And then he saw it. Half-buried in the mud next to Jonathan's body, trampled but not destroyed, was a single, perfect silver arrowhead.
It was not from any mortal quiver. It hummed with a familiar, chilling magic, a power he knew as well as his own. It was Artemis's craftsmanship. It was the signature of the Hunt.
The pieces crashed together in his mind: Artemis's fanatical hatred of men, her proximity to the woods, her swift and brutal justice. She must have seen him with the hunter and drawn the worst possible conclusion.
The storm intensified, winds howling as his sorrow curdled into something infinitely darker. The rain felt like needles, the thunder his heartbeat of rage.
"No…" The word was a low growl that vibrated through the very concrete. Then, it rose into a scream to the heavens, a vow etched in lightning. "ARTEMIS!"
He would make her pay. He would strip her of everything she held dear, just as she had stolen everything from him. The King of the Gods wept for his son, and the world wept with him.
Flashback end…
The world had ended in a hospital parking lot. For Zeus, the following hours were a blur of a pain so profound it was a physical weight, crushing his divine form into something small and mortal. He had torn a hole in the world to return to Olympus, not to his throne room, but to a secluded grove high on its slopes, a place he went when the burdens of eternity became too heavy. There, he did not command the storm; he was consumed by it. He wept, and the skies over the Mediterranean wept with him. He raged, and lightning scarred the heavens without thunder. He was not a god, but a father grieving his son.
He reached for a decanter of nectar, but his hand, still trembling, knocked it aside. The divine liquor was too weak for this agony. In a fit of despair, his form flickered, the edges of his identity blurring. The grief was too raw for the king of the Greek gods. Another aspect, colder, more disciplined, yet capable of burying pain deep within a rigid structure of duty, rose to the surface. Jupiter, the Roman Alter, did not weep. He sat on a marble bench, his posture ramrod straight, and summoned a bottle of the finest, most potent Falernian wine. He drank not to feel, but to numb. He drank to forget the feel of Jonathan's cooling skin, the final, trusting whisper. He drank until the sharp edges of the world softened into a tolerable haze.
It was in this numbed state, his mind a fortress against feeling, that a familiar presence found him. Beryl Grace, a ghost from a life that now felt a thousand years past, stood at the edge of the grove. She had always been drawn to power, to turmoil. She saw not a grieving father, but a monument of a god in pain. She approached him not with words of comfort, but with a silent, understanding presence. For Jupiter, lost in the void, she was an anchor to a simpler, physical reality. A distraction. A way to feel anything other than the hollowed-out agony in his chest. The night became a blur of another kind, a desperate, meaningless attempt to outrun a sorrow that was as vast as the sky itself.
Dawn was a betrayal. The pale light did not bring clarity, only a hammering headache and the cold, stark return of his reality. Jonathan was gone. And his family… Clara, the children… they did not know. The thought was a fresh lance of pain. He had to tell them. He had to look into the eyes of the woman he considered a daughter and the children he adored as his own grandchildren and lie.
He found them in the warm, sunlit kitchen of the home he had secretly helped them buy. The table was set for five. There was a high chair for little Mia. The scene of perfect, mundane happiness was a knife in his heart. Clara was humming, flipping pancakes. "Morning, Dad Z," she said, using the silly nickname the kids had coined. "You're just in time. The coffee's fresh."
He opened his mouth, but no sound came out. The words were ashes. It was then that the doorbell rang.
Two men in crisp NYFD uniforms stood on the doorstep, their hats in their hands, their faces carved from stone. Zeus felt the world tilt. He had to stand there, he had to listen, as a mortal man, Captain O'Malley, a man whose hand Zeus had shaken at a hundred department barbecues, explained in gentle, horrific detail about the "freak rockfall." He had to watch as Clara's face crumpled, as her knees gave way and he caught her. He had to hold his grandson, Leo, who didn't understand the tears but began to wail in sympathy, and his granddaughter, Mia, who kept asking, "Where's Daddy?"
He had to act. He had to let his own face pale, let a convincingly human shock glaze his eyes. He had to pull Clara into a hug, feeling her sobs shake his own body, and whisper the lie that shattered what was left of his heart. "What… no," he choked out, the words tasting like poison. "Clara, my dear girl, I am so sorry." He made the promises then, his voice hoarse with a grief they all believed was new. "I will take care of you. All of you. I promise. Everything will be okay." Every word was a betrayal of the truth, a shield he was forced to build around them, and it was killing him.
The funeral was a public spectacle of grief for a fallen hero. Fire trucks lined the streets. Hundreds came. But for Zeus, it was a private hell. He sat in the front pew, a hand on Clara's shaking shoulder, the other holding a quietly sobbing Mia. He wore the mask of a devastated old man.
When it was his turn to speak, he walked slowly to the podium, every step an eternity. He looked out at the sea of faces, but he saw only Jonathan. He cleared his throat, the sound echoing in the silent church.
He approached the podium as a man approaching the gallows, each step a monumental effort of will. The simple wooden stand seemed to loom before him, an altar of unbearable finality. He placed his hands upon it, not for support, but to feel something solid, something real, to anchor himself against the tidal wave of grief threatening to pull him under. The silence in the church was a living thing, heavy and expectant. He looked down at the casket, and the world narrowed to that polished box, that unbearable truth.
He cleared his throat, the sound raw and scraping in the quiet.
"They asked me to say a few words about my son." His voice was a low, broken rumble, far from the thunder that usually commanded the heavens. It was just the voice of a broken old man. A grandfather. A father.
A faint, sorrowful smile touched his lips, a fleeting ghost of a memory. "When Jonathan was a boy, he used to try and drag me outside during a thunderstorm. He'd say, 'Come on, Grandpa Z, it's just energy! It's exciting!'" A soft, choked sob escaped from Clara in the front pew. The sound lanced through him. He had to pause, collecting the shattered pieces of himself.
"I… I would look at his face, so full of wonder, completely unafraid of the chaos and the noise, and I would think… I have never seen such courage." His voice grew stronger, infused with a painful, piercing love. "That was who he was. He wasn't just brave when the sirens blared. He was brave every single day. He was brave when he chose kindness in a world that so often rewards cruelty. He was brave when he built a family founded on a love so pure and so steadfast that it… it humbled me."
He looked directly at Clara, his eyes glistening. "He looked at you, Clara, every day for fifteen years, like he was the luckiest man who had ever drawn breath. And he was." His gaze shifted to the children, and his composure nearly broke. "And you, Leo, Mia… you were his sun and his moon. His entire universe. To him, your laughter was a sweeter symphony than any ever played on Olympus. Your happiness was his only ambition."
His fists clenched slightly on the podium. "He was my son. Not by blood, but by choice. By a bond far stronger. He was the best of humanity. He was everything I have ever aspired to be: selfless, loyal, true." His voice began to shake, the godly facade crumbling completely under the weight of the lie he was forced to tell. "And the world is so much darker, so much colder, without his light in it."
A single, hot tear finally overflowed and traced a path through his beard. "We are here to say goodbye. But I cannot. I will not. I will carry him with me. I will see his courage in every storm. I will hear his laughter in the rain. I will feel his love in the embrace of his family, the family he built, the family I swear to you now, on my very soul, I will protect until my last, dying breath."
He looked heavenward, as if begging for strength, but it was a gesture of pure, agonized accusation. "Goodbye, my boy. My wonderful, brave boy. Thank you… thank you for choosing me to be your father."
His voice broke, and a single, genuine tear traced a path down his cheek. The congregation saw a grieving father. Only he knew it was a god mourning the beautiful, fragile mortality of the family he had failed, lying to them with every beat of his broken heart.
For two days, Zeus wore the mask of a grieving grandfather, his divine heart breaking with every lie. On the third morning, he kissed Clara's forehead. "I must settle his affairs," he whispered, a final betrayal. Then, stepping into a hidden alley, his form crackled with power. The call went out: an emergency council of the gods. Now.
Olympus
The grandeur of the Olympian throne room was a force unto itself, a space that defied mortal comprehension. The air hummed with the accumulated power of eons, smelling of ozone, ambrosia, and cold, polished stone. Vast pillars of solid star-stuff held up a ceiling that depicted the ever-shifting tapestry of the night sky, constellations writhing and reforming in real time. The floor was a mosaic of living earth, showing forests, oceans, and deserts in miniature, their tiny inhabitants going about their lives unaware of the gods who watched from above.
In the centre of the immense hall burned Hestia's hearth, its flames a warm, steady heartbeat in the cool, majestic expanse. It was the only source of comfort in a room designed for awe.
One by one, the thrones flared with light as their occupants materialized, their divine forms casting long, dramatic shadows. They arrived with the air of immortals abruptly pulled from more pressing concerns, their expressions a mixture of irritation and keen curiosity.
Poseidon, Lord of the Seas, sat upon a throne of carved coral and Leviathan bone. He smelled of salt and deep, dark trenches. His sea-green eyes, stormy and intense, scanned the room, his trident leaning against his armrest, droplets of seawater glistening on its points. He drummed his fingers, a gesture that made the water in every mortal glass on earth tremble slightly.
Hades, King of the Underworld, was a stark contrast. His throne was of polished obsidian and frozen screams, radiating a chill that even the hearth's fire struggled to combat. He was dressed in the robes of a wealthy ancient king, his form seeming to drink the light around him. His face was pale, severe, and etched with the patience of the grave, his fingers steepled as he observed the gathering with an air of detached, grim interest.
Hera, Queen of the Gods, was the picture of regal composure. Her throne of gold and peacock feathers was the most ornate. She sat perfectly straight, her hands folded in her lap, her beautiful face a mask of cool, unreadable neutrality. Only a slight tightness around her eyes betrayed her annoyance at the disruption to her schedule.
Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest, radiated a palpable energy of growth and sudden decay. Her throne was woven from living, golden wheat that swayed in a non-existent breeze. She looked anxious, her gaze distant, as if already calculating how this unforeseen meeting would disrupt the growing seasons.
Ares, God of War, slammed onto his throne of bronze and leather, forged from the shields of fallen heroes. The clang echoed through the hall. He was already grinning, a brutal, eager expression. An emergency meeting always spelled conflict, and conflict was his favourite pastime.
Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, appeared with a softpopof displaced air, already seated on her throne of silver and polished gray marble. Her stormy grey eyes were sharp, missing nothing. She held a scroll she had been reading, her finger marking her place, her entire posture radiating intense, analytical curiosity. She was already running probabilities in her mind.
Apollo, God of the Sun, arrived in a burst of golden light and the faint, fading chord of a lyre. His throne, shaped like the sun with rays fanning out behind him, seemed too bright to look upon directly. He looked mildly put-out, as if he'd been pulled from a particularly inspiring composition with a particularly interesting lady.
Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, materialized on a throne of shimmering mother-of-pearl and swan's down, smelling of roses and myrrh. She examined her own flawless reflection in a handheld mirror, sighing with boredom. Mortal dramas were her entertainment; divine politics were often so tedious.
Hephaestus, God of the Forge, limped to his throne, a magnificent construct of automated gears and shifting metal that whirred softly. Soot smudged his brow and his powerful hands were calloused. He looked merely tired, as if he'd been pulled from a complex project.
Hermes, the Messenger God, was already there, lounging on his winged throne of mercury and traveller's stone. He was juggling three celestial orbs, a look of amused mischief on his face. He lived for news, and an emergency summons was the best kind.
Dionysus, God of Wine, slumped onto his throne of grapevines and leopard skin, looking profoundly hungover. He nursed a double-sized goblet and muttered under his breath about "unreasonable o'clock" and "punishments" and "wood nymphs"
Hestia, Goddess of the Hearth, was the only one who did not sit on a grand throne. She knelt by her fire, tending the flames with a simple poker. She was a warm, comforting presence in a room of cold power, her simple brown robe a stark contrast to the finery around her. She watched the others with gentle, sorrowful eyes, as if already sensing the pain to come.
A tense silence settled. All were present. All were waiting.
It was Ares who broke it, his voice a gruff bark that echoed in the vastness. "Well? Are we just here to admire the architecture? Spit it out, Father. What's so urgent you had to drag us all from our domains?"
"Indeed," Athena added, her voice calm and logical, though her eyes were alight with the puzzle. "An emergency council with no prior agenda is… highly unusual. The threads of fate are disturbed. What has occurred?"
Poseidon leaned forward, the sea in his eyes churning. "The oceans have been restless for days. They sense a deep imbalance. Is this the cause?"
Their questions hung in the air, a collective demand for an answer from the one throne that still remained empty. The throne of Zeus.
The air in the throne room, already thick with divine power, now crackled with a tension so sharp it was a physical pain. All eyes were fixed on the empty hearth where Hestia usually knelt; even its comforting glow had been extinguished by the palpable fury radiating from the king of the gods.
Zeus did not merely appear on his throne. Hemanifested. The very ether tore apart with a sound of screaming winds and the ozone-scented aftermath of a lightning strike. He was the Storm bringer, the Earth-Shaker. His eyes were not eyes but swirling vortexes of a hurricane, and in their depths, lightning flashed with cold, murderous intent.
"We are gathered," his voice boomed, a tremor that vibrated through the marble floor and up into the very bones of the gods, "because there has been a murder. Not of a mortal. Not of a monster. One of our own has murdered myson."
The word hung in the air, devastating in its finality. A son.
Artemis, who had been sitting stiffly on her silver throne, her face a mask of cold defiance, went perfectly still.
"Artemis," Zeus thundered, the name itself an accusation. "You, in your arrogance and your fanatical hatred, sought him out. You saw his goodness, his light, and you deemed it a crime. You ambushed him. You crushed him. You murdered him in cold blood. Do you deny it?"
She rose, her power a cold silver moonbeam against his raging sun. "I deny nothing! I executed justice! I punished a violator of my sacred oath!"
A baffled silence met her words.
"Your justice?" Zeus's voice was a deadly whisper. "What justice?"
"He laid hands upon one of my hunters!" Artemis's cry was fervent, fanatical. "Hetouchedher! Heboundher! My lieutenant witnessed it! His death was not murder; it waspurification!"
Poseidon, his sea-green eyes wide with confusion, shook his head. "Brother, what is this? What son? What madness is she speaking of?" He looked from Zeus's grief-stricken rage to Artemis's zealous fervour, utterly lost.
Hera's regal composure finally broke into open astonishment. "A son? You have asonI know nothing of? Andshekilled him? For… touching one of her girls?" The Queen of the Gods looked as if the very foundations of her understanding had been upended. The scandal of a hidden son was momentarily overshadowed by the sheer absurdity of the reason for his death.
Apollo watched his sister, his face a war of conflicting loyalties. The golden light around him dimmed. He knew the crime was unnecessary, the punishment grotesquely disproportionate. He saw the fanaticism in her eyes, the same zeal that had always defined her, now twisted into something horrifying. He was on a knife's edge, torn between the sister he loved and the horrifying truth of her actions.
Athena said nothing. But the disappointment on her face was a colder, sharper weapon than any insult. She looked at Artemis not with rage, but with profound, analytical sorrow. She saw the flawed logic, the catastrophic misjudgement, the total failure of wisdom. This was not the sister she knew; this was a fanatic who had allowed dogma to override reason, and the result was a tragedy of epic proportions. She saw the path that had led here and knew Artemis had chosen every step, right off a cliff.
Artemis saw their reactions—Poseidon and Hera's confusion, Aphrodite's disgust, Apollo's torn silence, Athena's crushing disappointment—and a sliver of her unwavering certainty finally cracked. But the most devastating blow was yet to come.
She turned back to her father, her expression one of bewildered betrayal. This was the father who had always been a marshmallow with her and Athena, who had indulged their independence. "Father… you would take the word of a mortal-loving spy over mine? For a… amortal? You called this council over amortal?"
"SILENCE!"
The word was not a command; it was a cataclysm. It was the sound of a mountain cracking in two, of a sky being torn asunder. The very foundations of Olympus groaned under the weight of it. The assembled gods, even the most powerful among them, flinched as one. Ares's grin finally vanished. Dionysus sobered instantly. Hades leaned forward, his funereal patience replaced by sharp attention.
In the echoing aftermath of the roar, a new sound emerged: a low, deadly hum. In Zeus's outstretched palm, a single, perfect silver arrowhead materialized. It was not thrown, not presented as evidence. It wasdisplayed. It hung in the air between them, rotating slowly, and with each turn, it caught the light of the celestial ceiling, casting brilliant, accusing shards of light around the room. Every god present could feel its essence, the unique, cold, moon-touched magic that was Artemis's and Artemis's alone. It was a scent, a signature, a confession made of metal.
"You left your calling card, Daughter," he seethed, his voice dropping into a register of such profound, personal pain that it was more terrifying than any thunder. Each word was measured, weighted with a grief that seemed to dim the very thrones. "Your 'justice' is as sloppy as it is cruel. You were so consumed by your righteous fury, so assured of your moral superiority, that you did not even think to conceal your work. You believed the act itself was so justified that no consequence would follow."
He took a step forward, and the floor trembled. "You ask if I would choose him over you?" The question hung in the air, charged with a lifetime of indulgence now utterly incinerated by betrayal. He gestured not just to the arrowhead, but to the entirety of her defence, to the fanatical glint still in her eyes. "Look upon what you have done. Look upon the life you extinguished for a perceived slight, based on the testimony of a single, biased witness. Look upon the family you have shattered. Look upon the grief you have causedme—not as your king, but as your father, who loved a son you never bothered to know. You did not just kill a mortal. You broke an unbreakable trust. You forced this choice. So know the answer. Yes."
He rose to his full, terrifying height, the storm in his eyes eclipsing the room, his form casting a shadow that swallowed the light of the hearth. The arrowhead continued its silent, damning rotation.
"The council has heard the accusation," his voice boomed, formal and final, the voice of a judge passing sentence. "And we have heard the…defence." He spat the word as if it were a foul taste, making it clear her justification held less than zero weight in his eyes. It was not a defence; it was an indictment of her own character.
"We have seen the proof," he continued, his gaze sweeping over every stunned, silent face. "Proof of her presence. Proof of her method. Proof of her intent, gleaned from her own fanatical words. She stands not accused by me, but condemned by her own actions and her own pride."
He let the silence stretch, allowing the weight of it all to press down on every deity present.
"There are no more words. There is no debate. The time for excuses is over. The only question that remains is what Olympus will do about the goddess who believes her oath is a license for murder. The stability of this pantheon, the very concept of justice we are sworn to uphold, demands a response. There will be a vote. Now."
The silence that followed Zeus's decree was heavier than any mountain. It was the silence of inevitability. The king's grief was a tempest that had scoured the room clean of dissent, leaving only the stark, terrible choice before them.
Zeus's eyes, still swirling with the ghosts of storms, swept across the council. His voice was no longer a roar, but the cold, final scrape of stone on stone.
"The vote is called. All in favour of the permanent banishment of Artemis from Olympus, the stripping of her godhood, and her casting down to the mortal world… signify by saying 'Aye'."
He did not look at her. He looked only at his council.
Poseidon, his face grim, understanding the unpayable debt of a lost son, spoke first. His voice was the deep rumble of a tidal wave. "Aye."
Hera, her initial shock hardened into cold fury at the revelation of a hidden son and the chaos his death had unleashed, nodded once, sharply. "Aye."
Demeter, seeing only the blight of unjust death upon the world, whispered, "Aye."
Ares, who respected brutal efficiency but wanted to just see choas, grunted. "Aye."
Athena, her eyes closed in profound disappointment, her logic providing no other path for such a catastrophic failure of judgment, said softly, "Aye."
Aphrodite, her heart sickened by the perversion of love and compassion Artemis had displayed, did not hesitate. "Aye."
Hephaestus, who valued creation over mindless destruction, shook his head sadly. "Aye."
Hermes, the messenger who understood consequences, sighed. "Aye."
Hades, from the depths of his obsidian throne, gave a single, solemn nod. "Aye."
Zeus's gaze finally landed on his son, the only one who had not spoken.
Apollolooked at his twin, his face a mask of agony. He saw the fanaticism, the horrifying mistake, but he also saw his sister, his other half. His voice, when it came, was choked, barely audible, the only dissent in the crushing unanimity. "Nay."
The word was swallowed by the silence.
Zeus did not acknowledge it. He turned his terrible gaze back to Artemis.
"The 'Ayes' have it. The council has spoken."
The sentence was passed.
She was banished.
The final, echoing "Aye" from Hades seemed to suck all sound from the world. Zeus did not look at his daughter. His voice was flat, drained of all emotion, hollowed out by grief.
"The council is adjourned. The sentence commences in one hour. Use it to put your affairs in order. Then, you will depart Olympus. Forever."
With a crackle of ozone, he was gone. The other gods vanished in their turn, a silent, swift exodus of light and power, none willing to meet Artemis's eye. In moments, the vast, echoing throne room was empty save for three goddesses: the condemned, the judge, and the comfort that was no longer there.
Artemis stood as if turned to stone. The reality of it, the finality, crashed down upon her. Her silver eyes, wide with a dawning, horrified understanding, found Athena, who was slowly rising from her throne.
"You," Artemis's voice was a raw, broken thing, all her earlier fury extinguished. "Athena. You voted with them. Why?"
Athena met her gaze, her own grey eyes filled with a profound, weary sadness. There was no anger there, only a devastating disappointment. "I did not vote withthem, sister. I voted againstyou," she said, her voice calm and horribly logical. "Your justice was not justice. It was zealotry. You saw an act of compassion and called it defilement. You heard a single report and became judge, jury, and executioner. You did not seek truth; you sought confirmation of your own bias. You were too far gone to see reason. This banishment is not a punishment from us. It is the consequence of your own actions, finally and irrevocably caught up to you."
The words were a colder blow than any physical strike. Artemis flinched, taking a step back. Her gaze then shifted, pleadingly, to the one constant, the one source of unconditional warmth in all of Olympus. Hestia still knelt by her hearth, but the flames were low, guttering.
"Aunt Hestia…" Artemis's voice was a child's whisper, begging for solace, for the one person who would understand. "You… Please. Tell them. This is a mistake."
Hestia looked up, and the grief in her warm eyes was more terrible than Athena's logic. She looked as if her very heart was breaking. "Oh, my dear child," she whispered, her voice thick with tears. "My fire grows low with sorrow for you. But I did not vote because my heart could not bear to condemn you, yet my soul could not absolve you. What you did… it broke the first and most sacred law of this home: compassion. Perhaps… perhaps away from the echo chamber of your hunt, away from the certainty that has curdled into cruelty… perhaps this is for the best. Perhaps you can find your way back to what you were meant to be."
It was the final, crushing blow. There was no ally here. No defence. Only the cold, hard truth of her isolation.
A soundless sob shook Artemis's frame. Without another word, she turned and fled the throne room.
Hunters Camp
She appeared in the midst of her hunters' camp like a ghost. Her maidens looked up, smiles dying on their lips as they saw her expression.
"My Lady?" Zoe Nightshade was at her side instantly.
Artemis spoke quickly, her voice hollow, reciting the facts as if they belonged to someone else. "I have been banished. Stripped of my godhood. By the vote of the council. I have one hour."
The cries of shock and outrage were immediate, a symphony of fury. Zoe's hand went to her sword. "We will fight! We will—!"
"You will do NO SUCH THING!" Artemis's command cracked through the air, the last vestige of her divine authority. "The order is given. You will not seek vengeance. You will not defy Olympus." She looked at Zoe, her most loyal, her oldest friend. "Zoe Nightshade. You are the Lieutenant of the Hunt now. You will lead them. Protect them. Obey my last command."
She did not allow for goodbye. She could not bear it. She simply vanished.
Back in her chambers on Olympus, she moved like an automaton. She changed out of her silken robes into simple, sturdy hunting leathers. She emptied a small pouch of drachmas and mortal currency—a contingency she'd never thought she'd need—into a belt pouch. That was all she took.
As she turned to leave, Apollo stood in her doorway. He said nothing. His face was a mirror of the agony tearing her apart. He didn't try to stop her. He didn't offer empty comfort. He simply held out a crumpled piece of paper.
She took it, her fingers brushing his. No words passed between them. None were needed. He turned and was gone.
Clutching the note, Artemis walked the familiar halls of Olympus for the last time. She reached the edge, the precipice that looked out over the mortal world. She took a final, shuddering breath, and stepped off.
The feeling was not sudden, but a terrible, swift unravelling. It was like a thread pulled from a tapestry, the very fabric of her being coming apart. The world, once so clear and full of hidden paths, became dull and flat. The song of the moon, a constant melody in her soul, faded into silence. The strength that had been as natural as breathing leeched from her muscles. The cold of the wind bit into skin that was no longer invulnerable. She was unravelling, diminishing, fading into a mere echo of what she was.
By the time her feet touched the rain-soaked pavement of New York City, Artemis, the Goddess of the Hunt, was gone. All that was left was a lost, eight-year-old girl, drenched and utterly alone.
Flashback End
The bus shuddered to a halt with a final, wheezing sigh, pulling Artemis from the torturous reel of her memories. The driver called out a town name that meant nothing to her. New Jersey. This was the place.
She moved like a ghost, her small body numb, the worn leather of her sandals scraping on the bus steps as she descended into the unfamiliar, rain-washed world. The bus pulled away, its red taillights fading into the gloom, leaving her utterly alone on a quiet, tree-lined street. The note, now soft and frayed from her frantic grip, was her only compass.
128 Myrtle Avenue.
Her eight-year-old's legs carried her down the sidewalk, each step a monumental effort. The world was too loud, too bright, toorealin a way it had never been. She could feel every crack in the pavement through her thin soles, smell the damp earth and the distant, greasy scent of mortal food. She was a raw nerve, exposed to the elements.
And then she saw it. A modest, white-sided house with a dark green door. The numbers*128*were nailed neatly beside it.
This was it. The end of her journey. Or perhaps the beginning of a prison sentence. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, mortal drum. She pushed open the iron gate, its whine echoing in the quiet street, and walked the short path to the door. There were no more options, no more places to run. With a trembling hand that felt too small, too weak, she raised her fist and knocked.
The door opened.
Standing there, backlit by the warm, golden light of a hallway, was a woman. Her face was etched with a kindness so profound it was like a physical ache. Her hair was dark, her eyes the colour of twilight, and they held a deep, ancient sorrow that somehow also promised solace. She smelled of rosemary and dried lavender.
It was Leto.
Her mother.
Artemis's breath hitched. The world tilted. The last vestiges of her divine composure, the stubborn pride that had carried her across a continent, shattered into a million pieces. The weight of the banishment, the betrayal of her family, the horrifying reality of her mortality, the crushing loneliness—it all crashed down upon her at once.
She did not speak. A small, broken sound escaped her lips, a sob that had been trapped for centuries. The tears she had refused to shed on Olympus now fell in a hot, silent flood, streaming down her cheeks. Her shoulders slumped, her entire small frame beginning to shake with the force of a grief too vast for her body to contain.
Leto did not gasp. She did not ask questions. Her own eyes welled with tears, mirroring her daughter's pain. In one fluid, graceful motion, she knelt and opened her arms.
Artemis fell into them.
She collapsed against her mother's chest, her small hands fisting in the soft wool of Leto's sweater. She buried her face in the familiar, comforting scent, and she wept. She wept for the father who had cast her out, for the sister who had condemned her, for the hunters she had left behind, for the power she had lost. Great, heaving sobs that wracked her tiny form, the unadulterated anguish of a child who had lost everything.
Leto held her. She rocked her gently, her own tears falling into her daughter's hair. One hand cradled the back of Artemis's head, the other drew slow, calming circles on her back, offering a comfort so primal, so fundamental, that it could only come from a mother.
As the storm of tears began to subside into shaky, hitching breaths, Leto pressed a soft kiss to her temple. She pulled back just enough to look into her daughter's red-rimmed, silver eyes. Still holding her, she gently reached into the pocket of her apron and withdrew a small, familiar celestial bronze dagger—a twin to the one Artemis had always carried, now lost to her.
She placed it in Artemis's trembling hand and closed her small fingers around the hilt. Then, she touched her own heart and pointed to the sky, her gaze holding her daughter's, conveying a silent message of unwavering love and understanding.
And in that gesture, in the offering of the blade and the pointed glance heavenward, Artemis understood. Apollo. Her brother, even in her fall, had not abandoned her. He had reached across the world to the one person who could offer true sanctuary. He had sent her here, to their mother. He had ensured she would not be alone.
A fresh wave of emotion washed over her, but this one was different. It was not the sharp sting of betrayal, but the warm, salving balm of a love that had persisted through the ruin. Closing her eyes, she leaned her head against her mother's shoulder once more, and in the quiet of her own heart, she sent a single, grateful thought into the universe, a silent message for the twin who had, in the end, kept his promise.
Thank you.

Chapter 16: The Man-Wary Goddess
________________________________________
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, before I start with the usual shenanigans and excuses, I do read reviews and before starting this chapter, I want to address some of the recurring critiques I've seen so far.
'First, about the flashbacks and pacing' — yes, I know the flashback arc is long and the pacing feels slow to some readers. That part is intentional. If I skip or rush this context, the story turns into just another fic where things "happen" without proper grounding. Naruto's mindset, Artemis's behavior, and the choices both of them make later won't make sense without this foundation. I understand it requires patience, but it matters for where the story is going.
'Regarding villains acting illogically' — Naruto was literally considered an idiot by his own village for most of his life. Arrogance plays a huge role here. No one expects the person they've always underestimated to actually listen, understand, or connect the dots. Even in canon, political figures like Danzo, Homura, and Koharu held secretive and questionable discussions inside the village itself. This isn't villains being dumb — it's them being careless because they believe they're untouchable.
'About Naruto being "nerfed"' — this Naruto does not trust the world around him. He is cautious by necessity. Acting openly like a shinobi or showing his full abilities risks him being watched, studied, or used as an experiment. This is not a power-fantasy Naruto. If he solves everything instantly, the story simply doesn't work.
'As for Naruto's logic during the revenge arc', there's a simple reason for many of his choices: he's surrounded by people. He cannot casually use ninjutsu, clones, or sensory abilities without exposing himself. His cover as Dhrithi's "illegitimate grandchild" matters. One wrong move, and the entire situation collapses.
'On the topic of the story being "mislabeled as a crossover"' — it isn't. The crossover elements are coming. I'm developing Naruto and Artemis first because rushing a crossover without character grounding kills emotional payoff. Percy Jackson elements will appear when they make narrative sense, not just to tick a box.
'For those who say Naruto doesn't feel like canon Naruto' — that's intentional. I didn't want another Talk-no-Jutsu Naruto. I personally disliked that aspect, and this version reflects a Naruto shaped by loss, restraint, and distrust rather than endless optimism.
'About pop-culture references' — yes, I use them, and I will continue to do so. They're meant as flavor and parallels, not replacements for the story itself.
'Finally, update frequency' — that's on me. I acknowledge it, and I'm working on being more consistent going forward.
If you've stayed with the story despite its flaws, thank you. If you're here for where it's heading, I appreciate your patience. Now, let's move on.

________________________________________
The iron gate's whine faded behind her, swallowed by the deep, suffocating silence of the house. The downpour had soaked Artemis to the bone, her simple chiton a cold, heavy second skin, her sandals leaving damp prints on the polished wood floor. The warmth inside was not the familiar, divine heat of a sun-drenched grove or the cool glow of moonlight on marble. This was a mortal warmth—thick and close—smelling of dried lavender, beeswax, and something else. Something achingly familiar, something that made the stone in her chest fracture just a little more.
Leto did not speak. Words were useless currency here, in the face of this cataclysm. Her movements were slow and deliberate, a quiet ballet of care performed in the dim hallway light. She gently pried the small, frozen fingers from the fabric of her own sweater, her touch impossibly gentle.
Artemis offered no resistance. The storm of tears had passed, leaving behind a hollowed shell—numb, terrifyingly fragile. Her divine will, once a force that could command stars and silence armies, was extinguished. All that remained was a shuddering, eight-year-old body that craved warmth and darkness.
With a soft click, Leto closed the front door, shutting out the world that had exiled her daughter. She led the silent child down the hall, not by the hand, but by the simple, unwavering certainty of her presence. The bathroom was small, the air steamy and fragrant with chamomile and sage. Leto had already prepared it—a quiet testament to a mother's faith that her child would come home.
Still without a word, she helped Artemis out of the wet, clinging fabric. The sight of her daughter's small, pale body—shivering, vulnerable—sent a fresh wave of sorrow through Leto, but she did not let it touch her face. She was an anchor in this tempest, and anchors did not waver.
The bathwater was a perfect, blissful heat. As Artemis sank into it, the scalding warmth began to leach the deep, mortal cold from her bones. She closed her eyes, wanting to disappear into the steam. Leto knelt beside the tub and, with a soft cloth, began to wash the city's grime and tears from her daughter's skin.
The act was so simple, so profoundly mundane, yet it held an intimacy that felt more powerful than any ritual prayer on Olympus. It was the washing away of one existence, the tentative anointing of another.
Artemis kept her eyes shut tight, focusing on the sensation of the cloth against her skin, the scent of the herbs, the sound of her own shaky breath echoing against the tiles—anything to keep the howling void of her loss at bay.
Afterward, wrapped in a towel so soft it felt like a cloud, she was led to a small bedroom. Leto tucked her into the narrow bed, pulling the quilt up to her chin. She pressed a final, lingering kiss to Artemis's forehead, her own tears finally escaping to mingle with the dampness still clinging to her daughter's hair. Then she turned off the light and was gone.
The darkness was absolute.
And in that darkness, the silence became a roar.
The numbing shock began to recede, and feeling returned—not as a gentle thaw, but as a brutal, crushing weight. She was alone. Not just in the room, but in the universe. The constant, humming presence of the moon, the chorus of the stars, the whispered secrets of the wild—it was all gone. In its place lay a suffocating emptiness, a sensory void louder than any thunder. She was a limb amputated from the body of the divine, the ache phantom and all-consuming.
She curled into a tight ball, the soft bed feeling like a prison cot. This was her reality now. This silence. This weakness. This was what forever felt like.
Dawn was a slow, cruel affair. A thin, grey light seeped around the edges of the curtains, stubbornly illuminating the room. Artemis had not slept. She had lain there for an eternity, trapped in the rhythm of her own breathing—each inhale an effort, each exhale a surrender. With the light came the full, devastating awareness of her new existence.
She pushed herself upright, her arms trembling with the strain. The muscles in her back and legs screamed in protest, sore and stiff in a way a goddess's form never could be. This was the ache of mortality, the dull, persistent complaint of a body that could be worn down.
Her eyes adjusted to the gloom, taking in the room. It was simple. Sparse. And there, on the plain nightstand, lay the dagger.
The celestial bronze seemed to drink in the weak light, glowing with a soft, internal fire utterly foreign in this mortal setting. It was a shard of her old life—a cruel, beautiful relic. Her fingers, small and suddenly clumsy, reached out and brushed the cool metal of the hilt.
A jolt went through her. Not of power, but of memory.
Apollo's heartbroken eyes in her doorway.
This was not just a weapon. It was a message. The only tether she had left. She was banished, stripped, and alone—but not completely abandoned. The duality of it was a fresh agony. She had lost everything, and yet this one, small thing had been given back. She clutched the dagger to her chest, its weight both a comfort and the heaviest burden she had ever borne.
The scent of frying plantains and strong, dark coffee crept into the room—a bold, earthy contrast to the sterile, divine aromas of Olympus that still haunted her memory. It was an invasion of the senses, a daily reminder of her fall.
She sat at the small wooden table in the kitchen, her posture rigid, the celestial bronze dagger a cold, familiar weight against her thigh beneath the table. She stared at the wall, her eight-year-old face a mask of icy contempt, refusing to acknowledge the homely comfort Leto was trying to build around them.
Leto placed a plate before her—eggs, a slice of mango, a warm tortilla. The simple, nourishing food felt like an insult.
"The rain has stopped," Leto said, her voice a soft melody meant to soothe. She took a seat opposite her daughter, her own plate untouched. She watched Artemis, her gaze holding a universe of sorrow and patience. "The air is clean. It might be a good day to sit in the garden. The jacaranda trees are in bloom. Their color would remind you of—"
"Of nothing," Artemis interrupted. Her voice was not the commanding force of a goddess, but the sharp, brittle edge of a wounded child trying to sound imposing. "It reminds me of nothing. This place. This… mortal filth. It has no connection to me."
She finally turned her silver eyes—dulled now by a mortal's exhaustion—toward her mother. They burned with a cold fire. "Why are we here? Why are you content to sit in this… this hovel, pretending this is a life?"
Leto did not flinch. She folded her hands in her lap, a picture of serene composure, though her heart was breaking. "It is the life we have, my daughter. And there is value in it. There is peace to be found, if you would only let yourself see it."
"Peace?" Artemis let out a sharp, bitter laugh devoid of humor. "You call this peace? I call it a prison. A sentence delivered by a tyrant for a crime I did not commit!"
Her small fist slammed into the table, making the plates rattle. The gesture was meant to be powerful; it only made her look small. Desperate.
"He murdered a hero!" she continued, her voice rising. "A true hero! He touched one of my hunters. He defiled her. I saw the evidence. My lieutenant witnessed his violation. I delivered justice—pure, righteous justice." Her breath hitched. "And for that, I am stripped of everything? My father…" Her voice wavered, then hardened. "He chose a mortal over his own blood."
This was the core of the wound—festering, raw.
She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "He betrayed me. They all did. Athena, with her cold, logical disappointment, as if I were a flawed equation and not her sister. And Apollo…" Her jaw tightened. "His vote was a whisper. A coward's dissent. He gave me a dagger but could not give me his voice in that chamber."
Her eyes glistened with unshed tears of pure, unadulterated fury.
"They are all traitors."
Leto listened, her face a mask of compassionate stillness. She let the storm of her daughter's anger wash over her, absorbing its pain. When Artemis finished—breathless, trembling—Leto spoke, her voice unbearably gentle.
"Artemis… my brave, fierce girl. Look at what you are saying. You speak of justice. But was it just to be the accuser, the judge, and the executioner without a moment of inquiry?"
Artemis's eyes widened in outrage. "Inquiry? There was nothing to inquire! His guilt was plain!"
"Was it?" Leto asked. Her tone remained soft, but the question itself landed like a hammer blow. "Did you speak to the hunter who was saved? Elara? Did you ask her what truly happened? Or did you only listen to the fear in another's heart and let it become your own?"
A flicker of something—doubt, shock—crossed Artemis's face, only to be smothered beneath a wave of defensive rage. "Lysandra is my most loyal lieutenant! Her word is beyond question! She saw what she saw—a man handling one of my maidens, binding her with his belt! What other conclusion was there?!"
"The conclusion of context!" Leto's voice finally rose, not in anger, but in desperate emphasis. "The conclusion of a rescuer trying to stop a mortal wound. The conclusion of a hero who saw a wounded girl and a child in the path of a fire!" She took a breath, steadying herself. "You saw an act of compassion and called it defilement because your oath has blinded you to anything but your own dogma."
"Do not speak to me of my oath!" Artemis shrieked, shooting to her feet. The chair screeched backward across the floor. She was shaking now, her small frame vibrating with the force of her denial. "My oath is purity! It is safety! It is what protects my hunters from the corruption of men! It is all I have left!" Her voice cracked, then hardened. "How dare you try to take that from me too? You—who stood by and said nothing while he cast me out!"
The accusation hung in the air, cruel and unfair.
Leto's composure finally cracked. A single tear traced a path down her cheek, but her gaze never wavered. "I have never—and will never—stand by while you are hurt," she said, her voice thick with emotion. "But I will not stand by and watch you destroy yourself with this… this hatred."
She rose slowly, approaching her daughter as one would a skittish, wounded animal. "You ask me how I can be content here. It is because I have you. Because I have a chance to help you heal from this pain before it consumes you entirely."
She stopped a careful step away. "You did not deliver justice, Artemis. You delivered a tragedy. You killed a good man—a father, a son—beloved by his family and by your own father. Not because he was evil, but because you saw only what you wanted to see. You believed the worst possible interpretation because it confirmed the walls you have built around your heart."
Artemis took a step back, her hand gripping the dagger hidden beneath her clothes. "Get away from me," she hissed, the words laced with a pain so profound it felt like a physical force. "You sound like them. You are on their side."
"I am on your side!" Leto cried, her voice breaking with a mother's helpless anguish. "I am on the side of the daughter I love, who is lost in a darkness of her own making! I am trying to lead you back into the light!"
"There is no light!" Artemis screamed, the dam finally shattering. Tears of furious frustration streamed down her face. "There is only the moon—and I can't hear her anymore! There is only the hunt, and I am too weak to hold a bow! There is only my purpose, and it was stolen from me for doing what was right!"
She was sobbing now, great, heaving breaths tearing the air from her lungs. The moral high ground she clung to was a crumbling cliff edge, and she was teetering on the brink. "He was wrong! They were all wrong! I am not the one who needs to be fixed!"
Leto stood before her without touching her, her own heart shattered by her daughter's refusal to see. The helplessness was a physical weight on her shoulders. She could see the path so clearly—the catastrophic mistake, the pride that refused to acknowledge it, the grief twisting into a poison that would define her forever. And she could not force her to see it. She could only stand there, a patient, loving witness to the self-destruction.
"Oh, my child," Leto whispered, her voice breaking. "My poor, proud, wounded child. When you are ready to lay down this burden of being right, I will be here to help you carry the weight of what is true."
Artemis said nothing.
She turned her back, her small shoulders set in a line of absolute, implacable defiance. The wall was no longer just built—it was fortified, sealed. She stood guard behind it, alone in her certainty, a prisoner and a queen in her cell of denial.
Leto watched her, the patient architect of a sanctuary her daughter refused to enter, knowing the foundation would have to crack from the inside before any true healing could begin.
The silence in the small house became a living thing, thick with words unsaid and grief unanswered. After the storm of her outburst passed, a cold, hard resolve settled in Artemis's chest. Leto's gentle words, her patient sorrow, were a different kind of attack—one that sought to dismantle her from the inside out.
She would not be dismantled.
If this was her existence now—a mortal cage—then she would forge it into a weapon. She would rebuild herself until her body became a temple of strength even without divinity, until her will alone could bend the world to her purpose.
She would show them all.
Her father.
Athena.
Apollo.
Especially her mother.
The following morning, before the sun had fully breached the horizon, she slipped from her bed. She ignored the plate of fruit Leto had left on the kitchen counter—a silent peace offering. Dressed in the simple, sturdy clothing Leto had provided, she took her celestial bronze dagger and stepped out into the cool, damp air.
She marched into the woods behind the house, a place that felt like a pathetic mockery of her sacred groves. The trees were mere saplings, the undergrowth tame and orderly. It was a garden, not a wilderness. Disgust curled her lip.
This would be her training ground.
This pathetic patch of earth would witness the rebirth of the Huntress.
She began not with complex katas, but with the most fundamental thing: stance. She planted her feet, seeking the immovable solidity of the earth—the rooted power that had always been hers to command.
The earth did not answer.
Her legs—these weak, mortal sticks—trembled. Her balance wavered, her center of gravity a foreign, shifting thing. A growl of frustration escaped her lips.
She tried again.
And again.
Each time, the subtle, unconscious divine adjustments that had once existed were gone. She was a novice in a master's mind—except the body was a novice's too.
Next, she tried to run. Not a jog, but the ground-eating, effortless lope that could chase a stag for days.
Within fifty paces, a searing stitch stabbed her side. Her lungs burned—raw, inefficient—screaming for air they could not process. She stumbled to a halt, hands braced on her knees, gasping, sweat already beading on her forehead.
The humiliation was a hot coal lodged in her gut.
This vessel was useless.
Anger—her oldest, most reliable fuel—ignited. She would break it and remake it.
She drove herself through drills of strength and flexibility she had once designed for her newest, most mortal hunters millennia ago. Exercises meant to be challenging, but achievable.
For her now, they were agony.
Muscles she had never known screamed in protest. Each push-up was a Herculean effort; each lunge, a lesson in frailty. The divine mind knew the perfect form, the exact alignment—but the mortal flesh refused to obey.
It was like trying to command a puppet with severed strings.
The sun climbed higher, baking the moisture from the ground. Thirst—a base, nagging mortal need—clawed at her throat. She ignored it, channeling the discomfort into rage.
She was the Goddess of the Hunt.
She would not be bested by thirst.
It was then she saw it.
A flicker of movement in the dappled shade. A rabbit—fat, grey—nibbling clover, utterly oblivious to her presence.
A predator's instinct, deep and ancient, flared to life.
This was it.
A true test.
Not against her failing body, but against another creature. A hunt. A simple, clean hunt.
She dropped into a low crouch, the motion jarring and awkward. She gathered her will, all her millennia of experience, and forced it into her senses.
Listen, she commanded. Smell. See.
The world remained stubbornly dull.
The forest was a cacophony of meaningless noise—the buzz of insects, the rustle of leaves in a breeze whose direction she could not feel. The rabbit's scent vanished into a dozen others: damp earth, rot, her own sweat.
Her eyes—once capable of counting the individual hairs on that rabbit's back from a hundred yards—could barely track its shape in the shifting light.
She moved forward, each step a conscious effort at silence.
Twigs snapped beneath her weight, invisible to her diminished sight. The sounds rang out like thunderclaps.
The rabbit's head shot up.
Panic surged—not the calm focus of the huntress, but the desperate panic of failure.
She lunged.
No stealth. No patience. Just a frantic attempt to close the distance.
Her foot caught on a hidden root.
There was a sickening twist. A flash of white-hot pain tore through her ankle. The world tilted, then slammed down.
She crashed into the forest floor, the impact ripping the breath from her lungs. The rabbit bounded away, vanishing into the undergrowth without a backward glance.
For a long moment, she lay there, stunned.
The smell of loam filled her nostrils. Pain pulsed in her ankle, steady and merciless, in time with her hammering heart. Above her, the leaves of the pathetic, mortal trees rustled—utterly indifferent.
The Goddess of the Hunt had just been defeated by a root.
And a rabbit.
A sound tore from her throat—a raw, guttural cry of pure, undiluted fury and shame. It was swallowed instantly by the indifferent rustle of the leaves. She slammed her fist into the dirt, once, twice, the impact jarring up her arm. She had sought to prove her strength, and instead she had been handed a brutal, undeniable lesson in her own profound weakness.
She lay sprawled in the dirt, humiliation burning hotter than the throbbing pain in her ankle. The taste of soil clung to her lips. The rabbit was long gone. She, the immortal Huntress who had once chased the golden hind across continents, had been bested by a root and a common hare, with no witness to her disgrace but the trees themselves.
Tears of pure, incandescent rage blurred her vision. She struck the earth again, the impact a pathetic echo of the thunder she once commanded. This was not merely failure—it was desecration. Every pulse of pain in her ankle beat like a mocking drum, a relentless reminder of her mortality. Her divine mind screamed at the incompetence of her flesh, this fragile, flawed prison that could not execute even the simplest command. She was a masterpiece locked in a closet, a symphony forced through a broken instrument.
The urge to lie there and let the forest swallow her was immense. To simply… stop. To sink into the dirt and vanish from sight. But a deeper, more stubborn instinct—older than pride, older than anger—refused to yield. With a sound that was more sob than snarl, she dragged herself onto her elbows. Her ankle flared with white-hot agony, pain sharp enough to steal her breath and blur her vision.
She would not be broken by this.
If she could not walk, she would crawl.
"Well now. That looked like quite a spill."
The voice was calm, weathered—and utterly, terrifyingly male.
Artemis's head snapped up, silver eyes wide with feral panic. A man stood a few yards away, leaning on a wooden walking stick. He was old, his face a roadmap of deep wrinkles, his posture slightly stooped, but his eyes were a sharp, unclouded blue that missed nothing. He wore simple, sturdy trousers and a worn jacket. A mortal. A man.
He had seen her.
Every instinct she possessed shrieked in unison. The oath she clung to like a lifeline in the storm of her banishment cinched tight around her heart. Man. Predator. Threat. Her hand flew to the hilt of her celestial bronze dagger, fingers closing around the cool metal. She would not be vulnerable before him. She would—
"Easy there, little miss," the man said, his tone not condescending, but gently cautionary, like one used to soothing spooked animals. He made no move to come closer. "I'm not here to cause trouble. Name's Evans. I live just through those trees." He gestured vaguely with his stick. "Saw you take a nasty tumble. Heard it, truth be told. Sounded painful."
Artemis said nothing. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps. She glared at him, trying to summon the divine presence that once made heroes falter. It felt thin. Hollow. Like a child mimicking something sacred.
Mr. Evans's gaze flickered to her awkwardly twisted leg, already swelling, then returned to her face. His expression shifted—not to fear, but to practical concern. "That ankle's already going bad. You won't be walking on it. Not without help." He took a single, careful step forward, slow enough to retreat if needed. "Your mother's Leto, yes? The nice lady in the white house."
He tilted his head slightly, voice steady and unassuming.
"Let's get you back to her."
No.
The word was a silent scream in her mind. No, I do not need your help. I do not want it. Leave me.
She tried to push herself up, to stand on her own power and prove him wrong—but the instant she put even the slightest weight on her injured foot, pain detonated behind her eyes. White and absolute, it stole her breath and sent her crumpling back into the dirt with a choked cry.
The failure was complete.
Mr. Evans did not smile. He did not look triumphant. He merely nodded, as though her collapse had confirmed what he already knew. "Right then," he said mildly. "No arguments from the patient."
He moved forward, slow and deliberate, and stopped beside her. A gnarled, work-roughened hand extended toward her. "Come on. Up you get. Lean on me. It's not far."
Artemis stared at the offered hand as if it were a venomous serpent.
Every fiber of her being revolted. Accepting help was weakness. Accepting help from a man was a violation of her very essence. She wanted to spit in his face, to slash at his hand with her dagger, to command him to leave.
But the pain was a relentless, undeniable truth.
And the path home was long.
A war raged within her—silent, desperate. Pride, fury, ancient dogma on one side. Cold, incapacitating reality on the other.
Slowly, trembling with a humiliation far deeper than her fall, she loosened her grip on the dagger. She could not look at him. Her gaze fixed on a point beyond his worn boots, her cheeks burning with a shame that felt branded into her skin. She reached out and placed her small, clean hand into his large, calloused one.
His grip was firm. Steady. Impossibly gentle.
He lifted her with a strength that belied his age, taking most of her weight without effort. As she balanced on one foot, his other hand rose to steady her elbow. The touch was impersonal—practical—but it sent a shudder of revulsion through her.
"There now," he said, voice calm, unremarkable. "Take it slow. One hop at a time. I've got you."
And so began the most agonizing journey of her immortal-turned-mortal life.
Leaning heavily on old Mr. Evans, she hopped and stumbled through the woods she had so confidently tried to conquer. Every movement was a fresh lesson in helplessness. Every rustle of leaves seemed to whisper failure. She seethed, a silent cauldron of bitterness.
This was her first true lesson in the mortal world.
Not strength.
Not perseverance.
Vulnerability.
And her teacher was a man.
The universe, it seemed, possessed a truly vicious sense of irony.
He didn't try to make conversation. He simply guided her, his presence a quiet, steadfast support that she hated with every fiber of her being. When they finally reached the edge of the woods and her mother's house came into view, Artemis felt a new kind of dread coil in her chest. To be seen like this—broken, being led home by a man—
Leto was already in the garden. Her eyes widened in alarm as she saw them. She dropped her trowel and rushed forward.
"Artemis! Oh, my child, what happened?"
Mr. Evans spoke before Artemis could shape a lie. "Took a bad fall in the woods, ma'am. Sprained her ankle, I'd reckon. Seems a brave one, though. Didn't cry once."
The casual praise—so unearned, so misplaced—was the final insult.
Artemis wrenched her arm from his grasp, nearly overbalancing again in her haste to be free of him. "I am fine," she hissed, the words dripping with venom meant for them both.
Leto's gaze lifted to Mr. Evans's over her daughter's head. A look of profound gratitude and quiet understanding passed between them. "Thank you, Mr. Evans. Thank you so much."
"No trouble at all, ma'am," he said, tipping an imaginary hat. "You take care of that ankle, little miss."
With a final, kind nod, he turned and ambled back toward the trees, leaving Artemis alone with her mother, her pain, and the crushing weight of a humility she had never—ever—wanted to learn.
The screen door slapped shut behind them, a sound as sharp as the pain in Artemis's ankle. Leto guided her to a chair at the kitchen table, her touch firm yet gentle. The familiar scents of the house—lavender, coffee, earth—now felt cloying, a too-tidy cage for Artemis's raging shame.
"Let me see," Leto said quietly. She didn't ask what had happened. Mr. Evans's brief, gentle explanation had been enough.
"I don't need—" Artemis began, her tone brittle, but Leto was already kneeling, deft fingers unlacing the leather boot. Artemis flinched as it was pulled away. The ankle was swollen now, angry purple and misshapen—a grotesque badge of her failure.
Leto's breath hitched in a soft, sympathetic hiss. "Oh, my dear girl. This is bad." She rose and moved to the icebox, her motions efficient, purposeful. She returned with a towel wrapped around a chunk of ice. "Hold this on it. Keep it elevated."
Artemis took the ice pack, the cold a sharp shock against her feverish skin. She refused to look at her mother, staring at the wall instead, her jaw locked tight. The silence stretched—thick, heavy. Leto busied herself preparing a poultice: arnica and comfrey from her garden, crushed in a mortar with a quiet, rhythmic grinding that set Artemis's teeth on edge.
"You were training," Leto said softly.
It wasn't an accusation.
Yet.
"What else is there for me to do in this… this emptiness?" Artemis shot back, venom threading every word. "Shall I bake bread? Tend to your herbs? Perhaps I should learn to sew. A fitting pastime for a broken relic."
The grinding paused for half a second—then resumed.
"There is value in those things," Leto replied. "Peace." She did not look up. "But that is not what you seek, is it? You seek to dominate this world because you feel it has dominated you."
"I seek to be what I am!" Artemis's voice cracked. "I am the Hunt! I am not meant for—for stillness!" She gestured sharply at the quiet kitchen, the embodiment of the domesticity she despised.
"And what are you now, Artemis?" Leto asked, her voice still quiet, but threaded with something new—something steely. She looked up from her mortar, her gaze direct. "After today. What are you?"
The question hung in the air.
Artemis's face flushed. "I was ambushed by my own frailty. This… body betrayed me."
"The body is you now," Leto corrected gently, unyielding. She brought the poultice over and began applying it to the swollen ankle, her touch both clinical and tender. The cool, herbal paste offered a small, unwelcome relief. "It did not betray you. You betrayed it. You tried to command it as a goddess commands a servant. It is not a servant. It is you. And you treated it with contempt—forcing it to perform a dance it has not yet learned."
Artemis recoiled as if struck. "Contempt? I was pushing it to be stronger!"
"To be what it is not," Leto insisted, her patience thinning. "You are trying to build a skyscraper on the foundation of a sapling. It will only break. As it did today." She wrapped the bandage with precise care. "You are not listening to it. You are listening only to the ghost of what you were."
"The ghost is all I have!" Artemis cried, the humiliation of the fall—of Mr. Evans's help, of her mother's relentless logic—finally boiling over. "What would you have me do? Accept this? Accept this weakness? This helplessness?"
"I would have you see it!" Leto's voice rose at last—not to a shout, but to a powerful, resonant pitch that filled the small kitchen. It was the voice of a Titaness, not merely a mother. She finished tying the bandage and met her daughter's gaze head-on, her own eyes bright with unshed tears of frustration. "You are so consumed by what you have lost that you are blind to what is right in front of you! You see a man offering help and see only a predator, ignoring the kindness in his actions. You see a sprained ankle and see only failure, ignoring the lesson it offers in patience and limits. You hear my words and hear only an attack on your pride, not a plea for your soul!"
Artemis opened her mouth to retort—but for the first time, no words came. The raw truth of her mother's outburst left her momentarily stunned. The humiliation was no longer just from the fall; it was from being so completely seen, so precisely understood in her own willful blindness.
Leto saw the crack in the armor and pressed on, her voice softening into a weary, resolute calm. "You are trying to navigate a world you despise with a map that is centuries out of date. You are lost, Artemis. And your stubborn pride is the wall you are building around yourself to avoid admitting it."
She stood, wiping her hands on a cloth. "This cannot continue. I will not watch you tear yourself apart in this little house—raging at shadows, breaking your body against the unchangeable truth of your existence."
Artemis looked down at her bandaged ankle, the fight draining out of her, leaving only a hollow, aching exhaustion. "What alternative is there?" she whispered.
"We leave," Leto said, the decision crystallizing as she spoke. "We leave this place. There is a whole world beyond this garden, Artemis. A world of different colors, different sounds, different people. Perhaps if you cannot see the grey in the world you know, you will be forced to see it in one you do not."
Artemis's head snapped up. "Leave? Go where?"
"South," Leto replied, already thinking ahead. "To Mexico. But first," she added, her gaze turning practical, "we go shopping. You cannot see the world in hunting leathers and a borrowed chiton. You need to look like you belong to it, even if you feel you do not. Perhaps the clothes will help you finally step out of the past."
The statement was so mundane, so utterly mortal, that it became the final, bizarre twist of the knife. The Goddess of the Hunt—taken shopping. It was the perfect, crushing culmination of her humiliation. And for the first time, Artemis did not argue. She only nodded, a single, stiff dip of her chin, and looked away, defeated. The journey, it seemed, would be far stranger than she had ever imagined.
The shopping trip was a fresh layer of humiliation laid over the ache of her sprained ankle. Leto took her to a bustling department store, a temple of mortal consumerism that felt like a personal affront. The clothes Leto chose—simple cotton dresses, sturdy shorts, soft blouses—were worlds away from her hunting leathers. Each piece felt like a costume, a disguise for someone she refused to become.
She stood rigid in the changing room, staring at her reflection in a garish floral dress. A stranger stared back. A doll. A pale imitation of a mortal girl. The white bandage on her ankle burned in the mirror, an undeniable marker of her vulnerability.
She changed back into her old clothes in silence, movements stiff with resentment. Leto, perceptive as ever, made no comment. She simply paid for the practical trousers and shirts and led her daughter back out into the bright, noisy afternoon.
The street market was Leto's next attempt at "exposure therapy." It was a cacophony of life—vendors shouting, the sizzle of food, the press of bodies, a riot of smells from ripe fruit to frying oil to the faint, ever-present tang of exhaust. Artemis limped beside her mother, her senses—still painfully mortal—overloaded. She kept her head down, silver eyes narrowed, viewing the crowd not as people but as a shifting sea of potential threats. Every raised voice was a possible challenge, every lingering glance an assessment.
She was so focused on maintaining her defensive perimeter, on projecting an aura of do not approach despite her childish form, that she failed to notice the shift in the crowd.
A wave of bodies surged between her and Leto, who had paused to examine a basket of vibrant chilies. One moment, her mother's steady presence was an arm's length away. The next, Artemis was spun sideways by the current, disoriented and suddenly alone.
A cold spike of panic lanced through her—sharp, primal. The noisy market transformed into a hunting ground, and she was the prey. She tried to push back, to find Leto, but her injured ankle made her slow. Awkward.
Then he was there.
A man, seeming to peel himself from the crowd. Gaunt, with eyes the color of dead fish and a smile that never reached them. He moved with a deliberate, slinking grace, blocking her path and cutting off her line of sight to the chili stand.
"Well, well," he murmured, his voice low and oily, slithering beneath the market's din, meant only for her. "A little dove, all alone. Lost your flock?"
Artemis froze.
Every ounce of fear—every lesson from Lysandra's report, every instinct carved into her by oath and doctrine—surged to the surface in a roaring wave. This. This was what she knew. This was the truth she had clung to. The world was not grey; it was black, and here was the proof, standing before her, cold eyes stripping away any illusion of safety.
Her hand twitched toward the dagger hidden beneath her shirt. Her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird. Her worldview wasn't merely validated in that instant—it was sanctified by terror.
Before her fingers could close around the hilt, before she could draw breath to scream, the scene shifted again.
A shadow fell over them.
A larger man—broad-shouldered, solid as an oak—stepped between her and the gaunt figure. He did not shout. He did not make a scene. He simply placed himself there, back to Artemis, a living barrier.
"Problem here, Miguel?" the newcomer asked, his voice a calm, deep rumble. Not aggressive—but absolute.
The gaunt man—Miguel—flinched. The predatory smile vanished, replaced by a nervous, oily smirk. "No problem, Hector. No problem at all. Just… asking if the little girl was lost."
"She's not lost," Hector said, the finality in his tone leaving no room for argument. "She's with her mother. You should move along."
The transformation was instant. Miguel seemed to shrink, his menace dissolving into nothing. He muttered something under his breath, shot Artemis a last, fleeting glance—now wary rather than predatory—and melted back into the crowd.
Hector turned.
He wasn't young. His face was weathered, his hair streaked with grey, but his eyes were kind, holding a tired understanding of the world. He looked down at Artemis, who remained frozen, her hand clamped over the hidden dagger, breath trapped in her chest.
"You alright, pequeña?" he asked, his voice gentle now.
Artemis could only stare, her thoughts reeling. The predator. The protector. Both real. Both existing in the same space, the same moment. The black-and-white certainty she had clung to fractured into a thousand jagged pieces.
He did not ask for thanks.
He did not reach for her.
He simply intervened—and was already prepared to move on.
She managed a small, jerky nod.
Hector gave her a brief, reassuring smile. "Your mother's at the chili stand. Two rows over." He pointed with a thick finger. Then, with a final nod, he turned and disappeared into the crowd as quickly as he had arrived.
Artemis stood rooted in place, trembling—not with fear now, but with the aftershock of understanding. The noise of the market rushed back in, a deafening roar.
A hand touched her shoulder.
She flinched violently.
"Artemis!"
It was Leto. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with worry. "I turned around and you were gone! I was so—" She stopped, taking in her daughter's ashen face, the tremor in her limbs. "What happened? Are you hurt?"
Artemis tried to speak. To explain the man with dead eyes. The man named Hector. The collision of terror and safety that had split her certainty apart. But the words tangled in her throat—fear, confusion, and a reluctant, horrifying gratitude knotted together.
Seeing her distress, Leto did not press. She did not demand answers or offer empty reassurances.
She simply opened her arms.
Artemis didn't hesitate this time. She fell into the embrace, burying her face in her mother's shoulder. She didn't cry. She only shook, letting the solid, steady presence of Leto anchor her in the swirling chaos of her newly grey world. Leto held her tightly, one hand cradling the back of her head, offering no easy answers—only the silent, unwavering solace of a love that could withstand even the shattering of a universe. She simply held her daughter, safe in the heart of the chaotic market, as Artemis's old world died and a new, more complicated one was born.
The suitcases lay open on the floor of the now-barren bedroom like gaping mouths. Packing had been a silent, surreal ritual. Artemis watched as her mother folded the soft, mortal clothes—the tangible remnants of their humiliating shopping trip—and placed them neatly inside. Each shirt, each pair of trousers, felt like a concession. Her celestial bronze dagger, wrapped in a soft cloth, was nestled at the very bottom of her bag. A secret. A final link to a self she could no longer reach.
She had expected a sense of escape as they loaded the taxi, as the familiar streets of their New Jersey town blurred past. Instead, there was only a hollow numbness. The car smelled of stale air freshener and vinyl, a pale mockery of the chariots of sunbeams and moonrays that were her birthright.
Newark Airport was a temple of controlled chaos—a roaring beast of steel, glass, and humanity. The sheer scale of it was overwhelming. The lines, the uniformed agents, the impatient shuffle of countless strangers—it was a brutal lesson in mortal magnitude and her own insignificance within it. She clung to her mother's side, small hand gripping Leto's, her usual defiant pride extinguished by the deafening anonymity. She was no one here. A name on a ticket. A body in a seat.
And then—the plane.
The pressurized cabin was a claustrophobic tube, reeking of recycled air and disinfectant. Artemis stared through the small, thick window as the ground fell away, the world shrinking into a patchwork of meaningless squares. The immense, silent force of the ascent was a pathetic imitation of flight. There was no wind in her hair, no surge of divine power. Only the dull, unnatural thrum of engines.
She glanced at Leto, who sat with her eyes closed, her face serene. She had traded Olympus for this. For a metal bird carrying them south, into the unknown.
Artemis turned back to the window, watching America disappear beneath a blanket of clouds. She was not escaping her fate. She was flying directly toward it—strapped into a seat she could barely see over, a goddess brought lower than she had ever thought possible.
MT. OLYMPUS
The air on Olympus—once thrumming with the vibrant, chaotic energy of divine squabbles and triumphs—had grown still and heavy. It was the stillness of a held breath, the oppressive silence of a throne room after an execution. A year had passed. The golden apples in Hera's orchard seemed duller, the nectar a shade less sweet. A pall had fallen over the mountain, and at its center sat Zeus.
His grief for Jonathan Stone had not softened. It had curdled.
It fermented in the silent, empty halls of his palaces into a dark, potent wine of paranoia and rage. Where once his laughter shook the heavens, now only low, rolling thunder muttered in the distance—a constant threat without release. He saw slights everywhere. A delayed answer from Poseidon was no longer forgetfulness, but calculated disrespect. A thoughtful silence from Athena was not contemplation, but conspiracy.
His eyes, once the clear blue of a summer sky, now churned with the perpetual grey of a gathering storm. They missed nothing. They trusted no one.
He spent hours staring into the polished floor of his throne room, seeing not his reflection, but the broken body of the man he had called son. The memory was a festering wound, and he worried it constantly, keeping it raw. Artemis's banishment was no longer merely punishment—it was proof. Proof that his word was law. That his wrath was absolute.
It was a hollow victory.
The emptiness Jonathan left behind was a void not even absolute power could fill, and it was slowly driving the King of the Gods mad. His commands grew arbitrary. His judgments became swifter, harsher. The other Olympians learned to tread lightly, speaking in careful, measured tones, their familiar games and rivalries subdued beneath the weight of his unpredictable temper.
The pantheon had fractured.
Each god retreated to their domain, the usual revelry and gossip of Olympus stifled, drowned beneath the thunder of a grieving king.
Poseidon brooded in his underwater halls, the seas growing more tempestuous and unpredictable as his frustration with his brother's decaying mood deepened. He missed the old rivalry, the boisterous arguments, the clash of storms and thunder. This new, bitter silence was worse.
Hera maintained her regal composure, but a tightness had settled permanently around her eyes. The revelation of a hidden, beloved mortal son had reopened every ancient wound of betrayal. Her bitterness toward Zeus was now laced with a cold, satisfied disgust that he had finally suffered a loss he could not simply thunder his way out of.
Athena's library became her sanctuary. She analyzed the situation with merciless logic, seeing the catastrophic erosion of her father's reason and the destabilization of the entire pantheon. She saw it all, understood the trajectory, and found no strategy capable of altering it. Her disappointment in Artemis had been profound, but her despair for her father was a quieter, deeper ache.
Ares was perhaps the only one who thrived in the new atmosphere, the pervasive tension a poor substitute for the war he craved. He fed on the unspoken anger, the clipped words, the constant threat of violence simmering just beneath the surface.
And Apollo.
His light was dimmed. The sun still crossed the sky, his music remained flawless, but it was performed by rote. The golden radiance that usually haloed him was muted. He was a portrait of grief. His twin's absence was a physical pain, a constant ache like a limb torn away. He replayed his lone, whispered nay in the council a thousand times, wondering if a louder voice—a defiant stand—might have changed anything.
Sometimes, he visited Leto's empty cottage on Delos, sitting in the silence, the one place where he felt closest to the two pieces of his heart now missing. He was the god of truth, living in a palace of lies and unspoken grief, and it was withering his soul.
Far below, in the mortal world, the Hunters of Artemis were shadows of their former selves. Their silver had dulled. Their camp—once a place of fierce joy and sisterhood—had become a silent, grim garrison. Zoë Nightshade, as Lieutenant, held them together with iron will and shared sorrow, but the guiding light of their goddess was gone.
Their purpose felt blurred. The hunt continued, but it was mechanical, a habit maintained out of duty rather than passion. They spoke less. They never laughed. They had folded inward, a closed circle of grief and loyalty, waiting for a dawn they feared might never come.
The world felt darker, and they moved through it as sharp, silver ghosts—forever missing the moon that had given them their light.
The plane's descent was a rough, rattling affair—entirely too mortal for Artemis's comfort. The world beyond the small window shifted from endless blue to a dramatic tapestry of rugged brown mountains, sprawling, dusty cities, and sudden flashes of brilliant turquoise sea. The air in the cabin grew thick and warm. When the wheels finally screeched onto the tarmac of Benito Juárez International Airport, a jolt went through her—not of arrival, but of finality. There was no going back.
The airport surged with humid, chaotic energy. The language swirling around them was a rapid, melodic torrent she could not parse, a sharp contrast to the harsh familiarity of English. Signs became puzzles of accents and looping letters. She clutched her lone suitcase, knuckles white, while Leto—calm, practiced—guided them through customs and flagged down a taxi.
The cab ride was a sensory assault.
Mexico City roared and pulsed around them—a vibrant, overwhelming beast of color and sound. The rigid order of American streets vanished, replaced by a chaotic dance of cars, brightly painted buses, and street vendors threading through traffic. The air reeked of exhaust and grilling meat, underscored by something sweet and floral she could not name. Music spilled from open windows. Everywhere she looked, life was lived in the open—loud, uncontained, unapologetic.
Artemis stared in silence, her face a mask of overwhelmed disdain. Beneath it, however, a reluctant flicker of curiosity stirred. This was not the quiet, ordered prison of Leto's New Jersey home.
This was something else.
Something wilder.
After nearly an hour winding through the vast city, the urban crush began to loosen. Neighborhoods quieted. Buildings sank lower, painted in faded pinks, blues, and yellows. At last, the taxi turned onto a narrow cobblestone street and stopped before a high wall washed in sun-bleached terracotta. A heavy wooden door, studded with black iron, waited at its center.
Leto paid the driver and led Artemis through.
The contrast was immediate.
The street's noise vanished, replaced by a profound, sun-drenched stillness. They stood in a secluded courtyard. An ancient jacaranda wept purple blossoms over a central fountain, water murmuring into a basin of moss-darkened tile. Bougainvillea erupted in violent bursts of magenta and orange against whitewashed walls. The air was fragrant with hibiscus and wet earth.
The house beyond was low and sprawling, with deep-set windows and a shaded veranda. It was old, simple, and beautiful in a way that felt grounded rather than divine.
It felt like a place that held its breath.
Wordlessly, Leto unlocked the heavy front door. The interior was cool and dim, smelling of lemon polish and decades of sunlight baked into clay tiles. The rooms were spacious yet spare—a few woven rugs, sturdy wooden furniture, and empty bookshelves waiting for a life to be lived.
They unpacked in near silence, the only sounds the soft rustle of clothing and the distant coo of a dove. Artemis placed her few new outfits into the carved wooden wardrobe of her room. Last, she unwrapped the celestial bronze dagger. She held it for a moment, the cool, divine metal a jarring contrast to the warm, mortal simplicity around her. It looked alien here—a relic from a forgotten age. She slid it into the bottom drawer of the nightstand, hiding it away, a secret seed of a past life planted in unfamiliar soil.
She returned to the courtyard, where Leto stood with her hands resting on the rim of the fountain.
"This is it," Leto said softly, her voice echoing in the open space. "Home."
Artemis did not reply. She tilted her head, studying the slice of deep blue sky framed by the courtyard walls. It was a different blue than Olympus's or New Jersey's—closer, heavier. She was no longer trapped in a cage of quiet order. She was in a new world: vibrant, loud, and utterly unknown. The walls were gone.
The training—the real training—could now begin.
That sun-drenched silence was soon broken by a new, more maddening one: the silence of incomprehension. For Artemis, whose divine awareness had once let her understand the chirping of sparrows and the rumble of titans alike, the loss of language was a humiliation as sharp as any physical wound.
The world became a cacophony of meaningless sound. The rapid, musical Spanish of shopkeepers, the laughter of children in the street, radio voices spilling from open windows—it all blurred into an impenetrable wall. She was an island in a sea of conversation, cut off and adrift. Leto, of course, spoke it fluently, her voice slipping into the rhythm with an ease that felt like betrayal.
The lessons began out of necessity.
Leto pointed to objects—a cup, a flower, a chair—and spoke the words aloud.
"Taza. Flor. Silla."
Artemis would glare, her pride revolting. She was the daughter of Zeus and Leto. She did not need to be taught like a child. She repeated the words with a cold, precise accent born of a divine ear, but the act itself felt demeaning. She was memorizing sounds, not truly learning. The nuances of grammar—the verb conjugations, the slang—formed a labyrinth designed to mock her.
Her frustration peaked in the tienda de abarrotes, the small corner store. Leto sent her to buy eggs—huevos. A simple task. Artemis rehearsed the word in her mind as she walked in, the bell jingling overhead. The elderly shopkeeper smiled at her, a question already forming in his eyes.
"Huevos," Artemis stated, the word stiff and foreign on her tongue.
The man replied with a rapid, friendly stream of Spanish she couldn't follow. He gestured toward the shelves behind him—how many? A dozen? Half a dozen? Panic, cold and familiar, prickled through her chest. She froze, the trivial exchange swelling into an insurmountable trial. She could only point vaguely, her face heating with a flush of pure shame.
The man, kind, handed her a dozen, sparing her further embarrassment. She shoved the money at him and fled, the carton of eggs clutched tight—an awkward, fragile monument to her failure.
It was a lesson in humility more effective than any scolding from her mother. She could not dominate this. She could not bend it to her will. She had to surrender—to become a student, to be ignorant, to be vulnerable. The realization was a bitter draught, but she began, grudgingly, to swallow it.
She listened more closely after that, straining to catch repeated words, patterns, rhythms. Her divine memory—once used to catalogue constellations and the names of every beast that walked the earth—was repurposed for the painstaking work of building a new lexicon, sound by sound.
The Spanish language was a cage. Each unfamiliar word was a bar, locking Artemis away from the world she was forced to inhabit. She sat at the rough-hewn wooden table in the courtyard, a beginner's workbook open before her.
El niño. La niña. El hombre. La mujer.
The words were simple. Childish. They mocked her.
Her divine mind—once capable of holding entire libraries from forgotten civilizations—struggled with the arbitrary gender of a noun. The frustration coiled hot and tight in her stomach. Leto's patient corrections felt like salt pressed into an open wound. To be reduced to this—to a stumbling, ignorant child—was an agony far deeper than any physical training.
Seeking escape from the silent judgment of the workbook, she fled to the town's zócalo. The vibrant square was usually an assault on her senses, but today its chaos was preferable to her own failing mind. She found a bench half-hidden beneath the sprawling branches of a fragrant laurel tree, a reluctant spectator to the pageant of mortal life.
Her gaze—sharp and analytical even in mortality—swept the square. It catalogued threats, assessed movement, habits millennia old. She saw old men at dominoes, their laughter dry as rustling leaves. She saw women talking in clusters, hands flashing as they spoke.
Then her focus narrowed.
A man sat on the sun-warmed stone rim of the central fountain.
He was a fisherman—she could read it in the geography of his body. His skin was bronzed and weathered by sun and salt, etched with lines earned squinting toward distant horizons. His hands, resting on his knees, were broad and calloused, nails short and practical, marked with the ghosts of rope burns and fish scales. They were weapons. Tools of a hard, physical life.
But they were not holding a tool now.
They were buried in the riot of dark curls belonging to a little girl standing between his knees—his daughter. Her face mirrored his, softened by childhood. Her hair was a tangled aftermath of play. And the fisherman, with a concentration befitting a master craftsman restoring something precious, was braiding it.
Artemis watched, utterly transfixed.
The contradiction was staggering. Those hands—capable of hauling heavy nets from a treacherous sea, of wrestling thrashing fish—now moved with meticulous gentleness. Thick fingers, seemingly too blunt for such work, separated strands with infinite patience. He did not tug or pull. He wove. Each crossing deliberate, careful—a silent language spoken through touch.
The little girl sat perfectly still, trust absolute, her small body leaning back against his legs.
When the braid was complete, he produced a frayed blue ribbon from the pocket of his worn trousers—a small treasure saved for this purpose—and tied it off. Then he raised his hands, spreading ten work-roughened fingers.
"Uno, dos, tres…" he counted, his voice a low, warm rumble, like waves smoothing stones on a beach.
The girl giggled, a sound like tiny bells, and lifted her own small, perfect hands. "Cuatro, cinco, seis…" she continued, her voice chirping with fierce concentration.
He did not correct her. He did not hurry her. He only watched—eyes that had surely faced down squalls and judged the moods of the deep now softened by unguarded adoration. When she finished, he beamed, a sunrise of pride that transformed his weathered face. He pulled her into a one-armed hug, squeezing tight, and planted a loud, smacking kiss on her cheek, sending her into fresh peals of laughter.
The air left Artemis's lungs.
The tight, angry coil of her frustration unraveled, replaced by a strange, aching hollow in her chest.
A memory surfaced—unbidden, sharp. The gaunt man in the American market. Miguel. Dead-fish eyes. Oily threat. The cold terror that had once validated every dark truth she believed.
It was followed immediately by another. Hector—the protector—solid as an oak, his calm, immovable voice a shield.
And now this.
The fisherman.
The provider.
The father.
Predator. Protector. Padre.
The three words formed a trinity in her mind—a brutal, beautiful, and deeply complicated truth. Her dogma, the rigid black-and-white law that had shaped her existence, had no space for this. It could not account for a man who was both physically powerful and tender, whose strength was spent on creation and care as much as survival.
The man before her was not an exception.
He was an entirely new rulebook.
Artemis remained seated on the bench as dappled sunlight shifted across the stone, the sounds of the zócalo receding to a distant hum. She was not merely observing a man and his child. She was witnessing the quiet, methodical demolition of her worldview—and she had no defense against it.
The walls around her heart, already fractured by humiliation and help offered by men, opened another fissure, letting in a thin blade of light she was not yet sure she wanted to see.
The first light of dawn in Mexico was softer than in New Jersey—a gentle wash of violet and rose over the rugged mountains. In this half-light, Artemis found her sanctuary: a secluded cove a mile from town, where the sand was cool and damp and the only sound was the rhythmic crash and hiss of the Pacific.
This was her temple now.
Her training was no longer the furious, self-flagellating struggle it had once been. The humiliation of the sprained ankle had been a brutal but effective teacher. She had learned to listen to her body. The divine knowledge remained—the perfect angle of a kick, the precise alignment of a throw, the instinct to exploit weakness—but now she negotiated with her mortal vessel instead of trying to dominate it.
She moved through the katas slowly, with a patience foreign to her nature. The burn in her muscles no longer felt like failure, but information—a careful mapping of new limits. She ran along the water's edge not to the point of collapse, but to find the rhythm where breath and stride aligned into something sustainable. Powerful.
Her body, once a traitorous stranger, was becoming an ally. It was hardening, the softness of a goddess giving way to the lean definition of a warrior. She was laying a foundation, stone by painful stone.
The grind was solitary, relentless, and hers alone. Each drop of sweat was a prayer to the self she was rebuilding from the ground up. By the time the sun crested the mountains, she was spent—body humming with a deep, exhausted ache—and a fierce, primal hunger clawed at her stomach.
It was on one such morning, hunger gnawing insistently, that Leto suggested the tortillería. "The boy there makes them fresh all day," she said. "They are the best in town."
The shop was small and open to the street, heat shimmering in the air, the comforting scent of masa harina curling outward like an invitation. A young man—no more than twenty—worked the press with rhythmic, practiced grace. He was handsome in an unremarkable, sun-warmed way, a lock of dark hair slipping over his forehead as he worked.
"¡Buenos días!" he called as they approached, his voice cheerful and open. "¿Qué les doy?" His smile was wide and genuine, reaching warm brown eyes that missed nothing.
Artemis stiffened immediately.
This kind of open, unguarded friendliness was a trigger. It felt false. Performative. A predator's lure wrapped in warmth. She met his smile with a flat, icy stare, ordering her docena de tortillas in a tone sharp enough to freeze the griddle.
The young man—Mateo, she would later learn—did not react. His smile did not falter; it merely softened into polite attentiveness. He nodded, filled their order, and handed the warm, cloth-wrapped bundle to Leto.
"Que tengan un buen día," he said, the wish sounding less like a habit and more like a sincere hope.
Artemis took the package, her fingers brushing the heat of the tortillas, and turned away without a word. She fully expected his smile to drop the moment her back was turned.
It didn't.
The next visit, her coldness was sharper. More deliberate. She was testing him—waiting for the mask to slip, for the impatient sigh, the rolled eyes, the leering comment she was certain lay beneath the surface.
It never came.
Day after day. Week after week. Whether she came with Leto or was sent alone, Mateo remained unfailingly, impossibly kind. His cheerfulness was not something he switched on for customers; it was simply who he was.
Artemis began to observe him—not just with herself, but with others.
She watched him help an ancient abuela steady her bags without being asked, his touch careful, his easy chatter soothing her flustered nerves. She saw him slip scraps of tortilla to the thin, hopeful street dogs that lingered nearby, scratching behind their ears and murmuring to them in a soft, foolish voice. She saw him laugh with the other vendors, the sound honest and unforced.
One afternoon, as they walked away from the stall, Artemis finally voiced her suspicion, her tone edged with absolute certainty.
"He is up to something. No one is that… pleasant. It is a strategy. A long con."
Leto stopped.
She turned to her daughter, her expression not one of irritation, but of deep, quiet sadness. Her gaze drifted past Artemis, back toward the tortillería, where Mateo was laughing as he helped a small boy stretch on tiptoe to reach the counter.
"You see a strength you understand in your training, Artemis," Leto said softly. "The strength of the body. The strength of the will to overcome. And it is a powerful strength. But when you look at him, you see only its absence. You call it weakness."
She paused, choosing her words with care. "That boy possesses a different kind of strength. A rarer one, perhaps. It is the strength of a kind heart that has not been hardened by the world. The strength to offer warmth without demanding anything in return. To choose kindness not as a tactic, but as a way of being. You spend your mornings building a fortress around yourself. He moves through the world with its gates forever open. I do not know which is harder."
Leto's words landed not as a rebuke, but as a key turning in a lock for which Artemis did not yet have the right door. She looked back toward Mateo. He was patiently explaining the price to a flustered tourist, his smile unchanged, unforced.
The foundation Artemis was building on the beach was one of physical power and control. Mateo represented something else entirely—a strength that required no dominance, no victory, no walls. It flowed outward instead of being hoarded inward. And try as she might, with all her millennia of experience in war and hunt, she realized with a sudden, unsettling lurch that she did not understand it at all.
The realization was not a triumph.
It was a frontier.
The sand was cool beneath her back, a sharp contrast to the fire that had raged in her muscles moments earlier. Above her, the sky bled from the bruised violet of dawn into a soft, hazy blue. Salt spray misted the air, and the steady crash of the waves was the only sound.
Artemis lay there, utterly spent. Her chest rose and fell in heavy pulls of damp, salty air. Every fiber of her being trembled with a fatigue so complete it bordered on peace. But the deeper exhaustion was not physical.
She had done it.
After weeks of failure—of stumbling, of her body refusing the intricate commands of her mind—she had finally executed the maneuver. A complex spinning kick, flowing seamlessly into a defensive stance, designed to disarm and disable a larger opponent. It demanded balance, timing, and a trust in her body she had not possessed until this morning.
It had been flawless.
For one brief, incandescent second, power and certainty sang through her veins.
And then the exertion dropped her into the sand, a puppet with its strings cut.
As the adrenaline ebbed, leaving her hollowed out and still, her mind replayed not the victory, but the ghosts of the past months. They flickered behind her closed eyelids—not as isolated moments, but as fragments of a single, impossible puzzle.
She saw Mr. Evans's gnarled, work-roughened hand extended toward her in the dirt, his kindness practical and unasked for.
The image twisted, dissolving into the gaunt, predatory face of Miguel in the market—dead-fish eyes, oily threat—a validation of every dark fear she had ever nurtured.
Then Hector stood there, broad back a shield, his calm, immovable voice a barrier against the darkness. A protector.
Her thoughts shifted again, settling on the fisherman in the zócalo—calloused, sea-rough hands weaving his daughter's hair with a tenderness that felt almost sacred. A father.
And finally, Mateo. His smile unwavering in the face of her hostility, his kindness a constant, baffling sun her cynicism could not eclipse.
Predator.
Protector.
Provider.
They did not cancel one another out. They existed simultaneously, woven into a tapestry far more complex—and more unsettling—than the black-and-white world she had ruled for millennia. The helpful neighbor did not erase the predator. The kind tortillero did not negate the need for the protector. The loving father existed in the same world as the man who had killed Jonathan Stone.
The truth was not a clean, bright line.
It was a murky, swirling grey.
A profound weariness settled over her, heavier than any physical fatigue. The rigid certainty she had clung to—the comfort of absolute judgment, the moral high ground of her oath—now felt like a child's story, too simple to survive contact with reality. The real world was not a story. It was a chaotic, beautiful, terrifying equation with too many variables to solve.
She had spent her divine life as an arbiter, delivering swift, final justice. Now, she was beginning to understand that understanding was infinitely harder than judging.
A single hot tear escaped the corner of her eye, cutting a path through the fine grains of sand at her temple. It was not a tear of rage or self-pity.
It was surrender.
Not to weakness—but to complexity.
The world was not safe.
But it was not universally evil, either.
She lay there as the sun finally cleared the horizon, its light warming her skin. The grey dawn was not just breaking over the Pacific; it was breaking inside her. The battle was no longer about reclaiming lost divinity or proving her strength. It was about learning to navigate the vast, unsettling, uncharted territory of the grey.
And for the first time, she was not raging against it.
She was simply… exhausted by it.
And in that exhaustion, there was a tiny, fragile seed of something new.
The sun climbed higher, burning away the last of the morning haze and warming the sand beneath her. The trembling in Artemis's muscles slowly subsided, replaced by a deep, thrumming awareness of her body—its limits, its new capabilities, its aching depletion. She pushed herself up onto her elbows, then into a sitting position, grains of sand clinging to her damp skin.
She looked down at her hands.
They were no longer the smooth, immaculate hands of a goddess, shaped to cradle a silver bow. They were tools. The palms were calloused, the skin toughened from gripping rough stones during strength drills, from the friction of the makeshift staff she trained with. A fresh, angry blister bloomed near her thumb from that morning's relentless work.
They were the hands of a laborer.
The hands of a soldier.
They were, undeniably, her own.
She had built them.
Her gaze shifted to her mother.
Leto stood a short distance down the beach, not watching her, but facing the endless expanse of the ocean. Her posture held no vigilance, no judgment—only quiet, patient waiting. She was not there to correct form or offer strategy. She was there to be a harbor, steady and unmoving, a place Artemis could return to when the world grew too loud.
Her lessons were of a different kind: the name of a bird in Spanish, the history of the town, the medicinal use of a weed near the courtyard wall. She was not teaching her daughter how to dominate the world.
She was teaching her how to live in it.
There, on the damp sand between sea and sky, a silent understanding crystallized between them—clear and solid, as real as if it had been spoken aloud.
Artemis would continue the grind. She would rise before dawn and drive her body to its breaking point and beyond. She would forge herself into the most lethal weapon a mortal form could contain—honed by a goddess's knowledge and a warrior's relentless will. She would become strong not to reclaim a throne, but to ensure she would never again feel the helpless terror of being at another's mercy.
And Leto would let her.
She would not stop her. But she would stand as conscience and compass. She would continue to gently, persistently expose her daughter to the messy, complicated, beautiful reality of the world she was preparing to fight in. She would ensure that the hand that held the weapon understood the weight of the life it was capable of taking. She would be the keeper of the why.
Artemis looked from her calloused hands to her mother's serene profile, and then back again. The war was not over; it had simply changed shape. The external battle against circumstance would be waged on this beach with sweat and will. The internal war—the struggle to reconcile predator, protector, father, and tortillero—would be fought in quiet moments, in conversations with her mother, in observation rather than judgment.
She rose slowly to her feet, her body protesting but obeying. She did not look at Leto again.
She didn't need to.
The pact was sealed.
She turned and began the walk back toward the house, her steps slower now, thoughtful. The chapter of blind, rage-fueled resistance was closed. A new one had begun. She was no longer merely a hostile observer or a bitter exile.
She was a student.
And her curriculum was the entirety of the complex, grey, bewildering world she was destined to walk.

"Walk," Leto said again, her hand firm but not rough at Artemis' shoulder.
"I am walking," Artemis snapped, though her feet had slowed to a near stop.
The street was louder today. Not dangerously so — just alive. Voices layered over one another, laughter spilling from open doorways, vendors calling out prices. Men moved through the crowd with the ease of people who did not think about where they placed their feet.
Artemis felt every step.
"They're everywhere," she muttered, eyes fixed ahead.
Leto guided her gently out of the way as a group passed. "So are we," she said. Her voice was calm, but tired around the edges.
"That's not the same." Artemis jerked her shoulder free. "They belong here."
"And you don't?" Leto asked.
Artemis stopped walking altogether. "Don't do that."
"Do what?"
"Pretend this is normal." Her voice rose despite her effort to keep it flat. A man brushed past them, murmuring an apology without breaking stride. The casualness of it made her stomach twist. "You think if I stay long enough, I'll stop noticing."
Leto turned fully toward her. "I think noticing isn't the same as hating."
"That's a lie." Artemis' hands clenched at her sides. "If I notice, I remember. And if I remember, I get angry."
Leto's mouth tightened. "And anger keeps you sharp."
"It keeps me right."
They stood there, the noise pressing in around them. Men passed. Some laughed. Some argued. Some barely looked at her at all. Nothing happened. No threat rose to meet her fury. The world refused to confirm what she felt burning in her chest.
Artemis hated that more than anything.
"You don't hear it," she said suddenly. "The way they talk. You don't feel it in your bones the way I do."
Leto opened her mouth — then closed it again. The answer she wanted didn't exist.
"I feel different things," she said at last. "That doesn't mean I feel nothing."
Artemis laughed, sharp and humorless. "Then why are we still here?"
Because running won't save you. Because standing here is costing you less than leaving. Because I don't know what else to do.
"Because," Leto said instead, "we're not done yet."
Artemis looked away, jaw tight. Being told she wasn't done felt like another punishment layered on top of the first.
"Come on," Leto said, softer now. "Just a little farther."
Artemis moved — not because she agreed, but because stopping would mean losing ground she wasn't ready to give up.
They hadn't gone far.
The market narrowed into a knot of bodies and sound, the air thick with heat and voices. Leto slowed instinctively, eyes scanning for space, for a way through that wouldn't trap them. Artemis felt it too—the tightening, the sense of being funneled.
"Stay close," Leto said.
"I am close," Artemis replied, sharp, already bristling.
A stall owner shouted. Coins clinked. Someone laughed too loudly behind them. Artemis kept her eyes forward, counting steps, measuring exits. That was when she felt it—the look before the movement, the attention that lingered just a fraction too long.
"Don't," she muttered, barely audible.
"What?" Leto asked.
A man leaned against a post near the fruit crates, older, eyes tracking them without shame. When Artemis shifted left, he shifted too. When she stopped, he smiled—thin, knowing.
"There," Artemis said, voice low. "You see him?"
Leto followed her gaze. The smile. The step forward that wasn't quite a step. The way his eyes dipped and lingered.
"Yes," Leto said quietly.
Relief flooded Artemis so fast it almost made her dizzy. "So don't tell me I'm imagining it."
"I'm not," Leto replied.
The man spoke—something casual, something that didn't need translation. Artemis felt her pulse spike. She turned, squaring herself between him and Leto, chin lifted.
"Back up," she said. Her voice didn't shake.
The man chuckled and took another half-step.
"Enough." Leto's voice cut in, steady but firm.
The man looked at her now, annoyance flashing. He muttered something under his breath, eyes flicking back to Artemis one last time before he turned away, disappearing into the press of bodies.
It was over.
Artemis stood rigid, breath loud in her ears. "There," she said again, louder this time. "That's what I mean."
Leto didn't contradict her. She rested a hand lightly at Artemis' back, grounding without caging. "You were right to notice," she said.
Artemis laughed, brittle. "Right to notice," she repeated. "That's not what you said earlier."
"I said noticing isn't the same as hating."
"And I said it is." Artemis pulled away, anger surging back now that the danger had retreated. "He proved it. They always do."
"Some do," Leto said.
"That's enough," Artemis snapped. "I don't need 'some.' I need you to stop pretending this is safe."
Leto closed her eyes for a brief moment. When she opened them, the fatigue was unmistakable. "I'm not pretending," she said. "I'm choosing how we move through it."
Artemis shook her head, fury tight in her chest. The proof burned bright, undeniable. She held onto it like a shield.
Because if she let it go—
then the world would get complicated again.
They didn't talk at first.
They moved away from the market in silence, the noise thinning into distant echoes. Artemis walked ahead, too fast, shoulders tight. Leto followed, giving her space she didn't feel entitled to close.
"You saw it," Artemis said suddenly, stopping short. "You saw him."
"I did," Leto answered. She didn't reach for her this time.
"Then stop saying it's the same," Artemis snapped. "Stop acting like this is just noise I can learn to ignore."
"That's not what I'm saying."
"That's what it feels like." Artemis turned on her, eyes bright, jaw trembling with the effort not to shout. "Every time you make me stay, it feels like you're telling me to swallow it. Like if I don't, I'm the problem."
Leto winced. "I'm not asking you to swallow anything."
"Then what are you asking?" Artemis demanded. "Because it feels like punishment. Like this is what I get for being right."
"That's not fair."
"I don't care if it's fair." The words came out sharp, ugly. "You weren't the one he looked at."
Leto's breath caught. For a second, she looked very tired—older than Artemis remembered. "No," she said quietly. "I wasn't."
"Then don't tell me how it feels," Artemis said. Her voice cracked despite herself, and that only made her angrier. "You keep saying you understand, but you don't. You get to choose calm. I don't."
Leto took a step closer, then stopped. "I don't choose calm," she said. "I choose what won't trap you."
"By trapping me anyway?" Artemis shot back.
The accusation landed harder than she meant it to. She saw it in Leto's face—the flinch she tried to hide, the way her shoulders sagged a fraction.
"I'm trying," Leto said. The words were simple. Too simple. "And I'm failing you right now. I know that."
Artemis stared at her, thrown off balance by the admission. "Then stop," she said, softer now. "Just stop making me do this."
Leto swallowed. She wanted to say I can't. She wanted to say this will pass. She wanted to say anything that would make it hurt less.
Instead, she said nothing.
The silence stretched. Somewhere nearby, a door slammed. A man laughed. Life continued, indifferent to the small war unfolding between them.
Artemis turned away first. "I hate this," she muttered.
"So do I," Leto said.
But they stood there anyway—neither yielding, neither winning. And in that space between them, something shifted: not understanding, not peace, but the quiet knowledge that this fight wasn't ending today.
They left the street behind and climbed the narrow stairs to the room they were staying in. The door closed with a soft, final click that seemed louder than it should have been. Outside, the city kept moving. Inside, the air felt too still.
Artemis dropped onto the edge of the bed, arms folded tight across her chest. She didn't look at Leto. She didn't need to. Her anger sat heavy and hot, a thing she held onto because letting it go felt like losing ground.
Leto stood near the window for a long moment, watching the light slide across the opposite wall. She could still hear the market in her bones—the noise, the closeness, the way Artemis' shoulders had stayed rigid even after they'd walked away. It wasn't the danger that troubled her most. It was the way staying here sharpened her daughter into something brittle.
"This place is doing more harm than good," Leto said at last. Her voice was quiet, not meant to argue.
Artemis' head snapped up. "So now you agree with me?"
Leto shook her head. "No."
That single word landed harder than a lecture. Artemis' jaw clenched. She looked away again, fingers digging into the fabric of the blanket.
Leto crossed the room and sat on the chair instead of the bed, giving space without retreating. She chose her words carefully, then let most of them go. Explaining hadn't worked. Reassuring hadn't worked. Staying hadn't worked.
"We're leaving," she said.
Artemis let out a sharp breath that was almost a laugh. "Because I was right."
"Because you're stuck," Leto replied, and immediately regretted how harsh it sounded. She softened her tone, not the decision. "Because every day here turns into a fight you don't get to rest from."
"And where does that stop?" Artemis asked. "We leave every place that feels like this?"
"No," Leto said. "We leave this one."
Silence stretched between them. Artemis stared at the floor, anger shifting into something tighter, more dangerous. Losing control of direction always felt worse than losing an argument.
"You don't get it," she said, quieter now.
Leto closed her eyes for a heartbeat. I do, she thought. Too well. Aloud, she said nothing. She began to pack instead—slow, deliberate movements, folding clothes that didn't need folding. It wasn't escape. It was choice.
When she finished, she paused at the door. "We'll go somewhere calmer," she said, almost to herself. "Somewhere we can breathe."
Artemis didn't answer. She lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling, anger simmering, resistance intact. But beneath it, something else stirred—unease, maybe. The sense that time was moving whether she wanted it to or not.
They left Mexico without closure.
The heat in India was different. It pressed down instead of closing in, heavy but honest, as if it expected to be endured rather than escaped. Artemis felt it the moment they stepped outside—on her scalp, along her spine, settling into her clothes. The noise was louder than Mexico, but less sharp. It moved in waves.
They didn't come here by accident. Artemis knew that much.
Leto didn't explain on the flight. She rarely did anymore. She carried herself with a steadiness that suggested the decision had already been argued through—privately, painfully—and resolved without Artemis' consent. That alone made Artemis bristle.
A woman waited near the curb, a hand lifted in a small, unmistakably familiar gesture. Leto's pace changed when she saw her—not quicker, not slower, just certain.
"Dhriti," Leto said, and there was relief in her voice that Artemis had never heard before.
Dhriti smiled, lines deepening around her eyes. "You're late," she said, the words light, practiced. She hugged Leto without ceremony, as if they'd parted yesterday instead of years ago.
Artemis stood a step back, arms crossed. She took Dhriti in quickly—plain clothes, steady posture, a presence that didn't rush to fill space. Nothing about her felt impressed or intimidated. That irritated Artemis more than curiosity would have.
Dhriti glanced at her, then away again, respectful in the way adults are when they don't know how close to stand to a child who doesn't want company. "This must be your daughter," she said, not asking.
Leto nodded. "Artemis."
"Welcome," Dhriti said. No warmth layered on top of it. Just the word.
They rode in silence through streets that seemed to fold into themselves—shops spilling onto sidewalks, people everywhere, men and women moving in the same currents. Artemis watched from the window, jaw tight. It felt like being dropped into the middle of something already in motion, with no edge to retreat to.
When they reached Dhriti's place, Leto exhaled as if she'd been holding her breath since Mexico. Artemis noticed. She hated that she noticed.
"You didn't bring us here because it's safe," Artemis said finally, when Dhriti stepped inside ahead of them.
Leto set their bags down. "I brought us here because I know her."
"That's it?"
"That's enough."
Artemis looked past her, into a home that wasn't arranged for guests or comfort, just lived in. She felt the familiar urge to resist rising again—sharp, reflexive. This wasn't refuge. It was proximity. People. Voices. Men outside, laughing somewhere down the street.
Leto met her gaze, tired but unyielding. "We're staying for a while."
Artemis turned away. She didn't agree. She didn't understand. But for the first time, the reason wasn't abstract. It had a name. A face. A history she wasn't part of.
And that made resisting it harder.
The street outside Dhriti's place narrowed as the afternoon wore on. What had been passable in the morning thickened into a living corridor—bodies, voices, heat rising from the ground. Artemis trailed behind Leto, hands tucked into her sleeves, eyes sharp and restless. This kind of closeness made her skin itch.
It happened quickly. Too quickly for warning.
A woman ahead of them stumbled as a crate tipped, oranges spilling across the road. She dropped to her knees, scrambling to gather them before they rolled into the gutter. A man shouted—impatient, sharp—and kicked one of the oranges back toward her with more force than necessary. Another man laughed. Someone said something Artemis didn't fully understand, but the tone carried enough meaning.
The woman's shoulders hunched. She worked faster.
Artemis stopped.
There it was. The tight, familiar burn in her chest—the sense of being proven right without having to ask. She watched the men hover, the imbalance obvious even without words. No one struck the woman. No one needed to. The pressure was enough.
"Hey," Artemis said before she could stop herself. The word came out rough, cutting through the noise.
Leto's hand came down lightly at her wrist—not restraining, just present. "Wait," she said, low.
Artemis shook her off. "You see that," she said, not asking. "You see how they talk to her."
"I do," Leto replied.
The woman finished gathering the oranges. One rolled away again. She reached for it, hesitated, then left it where it lay. One of the men scoffed as he passed.
Artemis' fists clenched. This was different from Mexico. This wasn't subtle. This wasn't a look that could be ignored or a threat that vanished if you stood your ground. This was ordinary. Accepted. A thing that happened because no one bothered to stop it.
"That's what I mean," Artemis said, voice tight. "That's what you keep telling me to endure."
Leto didn't answer right away. She watched the woman stand, dust herself off, and move on without looking back. The moment closed around them like a bruise.
"I'm not telling you it doesn't exist," Leto said finally.
"Then stop acting like it's rare."
Leto's mouth pressed into a thin line. She didn't contradict that either.
A few steps ahead, Dhriti had turned back. She hadn't said anything. She hadn't intervened. She simply looked at Artemis—not with approval or dismissal, but with something like recognition. As if she had seen this before and learned not to rush toward it.
That unsettled Artemis more than anger would have.
They moved on, the street swallowing the incident whole. The noise returned to its usual rhythm. Men laughed again. Someone called out prices. Life smoothed itself over.
Artemis walked with her jaw tight, heart pounding—not from fear, but from vindication. This, at least, made sense. The world was cruel where it mattered. Her anger had somewhere solid to stand.
And that made letting go of it feel impossible.

And that made letting go of it feel impossible.
The afternoon stretched thick and slow. Dhriti's ceiling fan pushed warm air in patient circles, its rhythm steady enough to fade into the background. Artemis sat on the floor near the window, back against the wall, knees pulled close. Outside, the street hummed—voices, footsteps, a vendor calling out something sing-song. Men's voices threaded through it all. She noticed every one.
Dhriti moved around the room with unhurried familiarity, setting out cups, rinsing them, setting them down again because she'd changed her mind. Leto leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, watching in the quiet way she'd learned to adopt when stepping in would only make things worse.
Artemis broke the silence first. "You don't say much."
Dhriti glanced at her. "I say enough."
"That's convenient," Artemis replied. "Means you don't have to take sides."
Dhriti huffed a short laugh and reached for the kettle. "Everyone takes sides," she said. "Some of us just don't announce it."
Artemis shifted, irritation sparking. "So which one are you?"
Dhriti poured water without answering. Leto's gaze flicked to her—not a warning, not a plea. Just attention. Dhriti felt it and rolled her eyes lightly, the gesture so familiar it might as well have been shared language.
"Your mother looks tired," Dhriti said, setting a cup in front of Leto. "You wear people out."
Leto snorted. "You say that like it's new."
"It isn't," Dhriti replied. "That's the problem."
Artemis bristled. "You don't know me."
Dhriti finally sat, elbows on the table, looking at Artemis directly. "I know enough to see when someone wants a fight."
"And?" Artemis challenged.
"And I'm not giving you one." Dhriti shrugged. "If you want to be angry, be angry. Just don't expect me to dance for it."
The dismissal landed harder than argument. Artemis opened her mouth, then closed it again. There was nothing to push against. No authority to rebel against. No rule to break.
Leto watched this exchange with something like relief—and guilt. She didn't step in. She let it stand. Dhriti noticed and gave her a sideways look that said you owe me later. Leto's mouth twitched despite herself.
Outside, laughter rose and fell. Artemis' shoulders tightened, then loosened a fraction when no one reacted to her reaction.
Dhriti stood and reached for a cloth. "Dinner's in an hour," she said. "You can sulk until then."
Artemis glared. "I don't sulk."
Dhriti smiled faintly. "Of course not."
Leto met Dhriti's eyes as Artemis turned back to the window. A brief look passed between them—tired, knowing, unspoken. Leto exhaled, some small knot loosening in her chest.
Artemis felt it without understanding it: the ground shifting under her feet, not because she was being forced—but because no one was pushing back.
And that unsettled her more than resistance ever had.
Evening settled in layers. The house softened as the heat eased, shadows stretching across the floor in long, familiar shapes. Artemis drifted to the far end of the corridor under the excuse of washing her hands, then lingered there longer than necessary. She could hear the kitchen—cups set down, a drawer opened, the quiet scrape of a chair. Adult sounds. Private ones.
Dhriti and Leto stood at the counter, shoulder to shoulder, moving around each other without looking. Dhriti reached for sugar; Leto slid the kettle closer. It was practiced, wordless, the kind of coordination that came from years of knowing how the other occupied space.
"You look worse than the last time," Dhriti said, not unkindly.
Leto gave a tired huff. "That was before."
"Before what?"
"Before everything became a negotiation."
Dhriti snorted softly and poured. "Children do that. You let them."
Leto leaned her hip against the counter. "You say that like I enjoy it."
"I say it like you're exhausted." Dhriti glanced at her, then back to the cups. "And stubborn."
"That's rich, coming from you."
Dhriti smiled to herself. "I never said I wasn't."
They drank in silence for a moment. Outside, voices passed the window—men talking, a scooter sputtering past. Leto flinched, barely noticeable. Dhriti noticed anyway.
"She's sharp," Dhriti said. "And she's hurting."
"I know." Leto's voice was low. "I don't know how to help without making it worse."
Dhriti set her cup down with care. "You don't fix this kind of thing. You stand next to it and hope time does its work."
"That feels like doing nothing."
"It isn't." Dhriti's tone was flat. "It just doesn't look heroic."
Leto laughed quietly at that, a sound halfway to breaking. "You always hated heroics."
"They're messy," Dhriti said. "And they make children think pain has an ending."
Leto rubbed her eyes. "You make it sound so simple."
"I make it sound survivable." Dhriti glanced toward the corridor. "That's different."
Artemis shifted, heart thudding. She hadn't meant to listen. She told herself she'd leave—but she stayed, caught by the way the two women shared the weight without naming it.
Dhriti picked up a plate and nudged it toward Leto. "Eat something. You get unbearable when you don't."
Leto rolled her eyes, but took the plate. "You're unbearable regardless."
"See?" Dhriti said lightly. "Sisters."
They shared a look—fond, exasperated, unguarded. Artemis felt it then, sharp and disorienting: her mother was not alone here. The world had a place where Leto could lean without falling.
Artemis retreated quietly, unease blooming where anger usually lived. She didn't know what to do with this knowledge. It didn't fit any argument she'd prepared.
And that made resisting everything feel suddenly… harder.
Morning arrived without ceremony. The house woke in pieces—the clink of a spoon, the fan's steady whir, footsteps crossing the hall. Artemis sat at the small table, tracing the grain in the wood with her finger. She hadn't slept well. The sounds from the street had followed her into dreams, familiar and intrusive.
Dhriti moved past her with a cup of tea, setting it down where Leto would sit without asking. Leto appeared moments later, hair still damp, shoulders drawn tight in that way Artemis had begun to recognize. Tired, but resolved.
They ate quietly. It wasn't tense. That almost made it worse.
Outside, a man called out to someone across the road. Artemis' hand stilled. She waited for the familiar flare of anger. It came—smaller, slower, edged with irritation at itself.
Leto noticed. She always did.
"You don't have to be on guard every second," she said, not looking at Artemis as she spoke. The words were careful, almost tentative.
Artemis' shoulders rose. "So now it's my fault if I am."
"That's not what I said."
"It's what you mean," Artemis replied, voice flat. She pushed her chair back a fraction, already retreating.
Leto set her cup down. "What I mean is—" She stopped, then tried again. "What happened before doesn't get to decide everything that comes after."
Artemis laughed once, humorless. "It already did."
Dhriti didn't intervene. She rinsed a cup at the sink, listening without pretending not to.
Leto's voice softened. "You're allowed to notice danger. I'm asking you not to let it become the only thing you see."
Artemis stood. The movement was abrupt, a line drawn. "I see exactly what's there."
"And when something doesn't fit?" Leto asked.
Artemis' jaw tightened. She didn't answer. She picked up her bag instead, slinging it over her shoulder as if preparing to leave a room she couldn't escape.
Dhriti turned from the sink. "The market's quieter in the morning," she said mildly. "If you want to walk."
Artemis shot her a look. Dhriti met it without flinching. No challenge. No invitation.
"I'm not hungry," Artemis said, already moving toward the door.
Leto watched her go, the familiar knot tightening in her chest. She hadn't pushed. She hadn't forced. Still, the words lingered between them—questions Artemis refused to touch.
Dhriti dried her hands and leaned back against the counter. "You poked the bruise," she said.
Leto rubbed her temples. "I had to."
"Maybe." Dhriti tilted her head. "Just don't keep poking the same spot and expect a different reaction."
Leto nodded, though the answer didn't soothe her. Outside, Artemis walked fast, shoulders set, certainty clenched like a shield. But with each step, it weighed a little more than it had yesterday.
The afternoon slowed into something softer. Heat lingered, but it no longer pressed. Dhriti sat on the low stool near the window, sorting through a small tin of old letters and photographs—things she touched without ceremony, as if they were tools rather than relics. Leto watched from the table, hands wrapped around a cooling cup of tea.
Artemis was supposed to be in the back room. She wasn't listening. She told herself that as she paused near the doorway, half-hidden by the wall, the voices drifting toward her.
"I found these cleaning," Dhriti said. "Thought I'd throw them out. Didn't."
Leto smiled faintly. "You never do."
Dhriti shrugged. She lifted a photograph—creased, corners soft. A man stood beside her, younger, uniform pressed too neatly. "He hated being photographed," she said. "Said it made him look like he was posing for a future he wouldn't get."
Leto didn't respond right away. She knew when to let Dhriti keep going.
"He wasn't gentle," Dhriti continued, matter-of-fact. "Not with words. Not always with patience. But he showed up." She set the photograph down. "When he didn't, it was never because he didn't care. It was because he couldn't."
"That's not an excuse," Leto said quietly.
"No," Dhriti agreed. "It's an explanation. They're different."
Leto exhaled, the tension in her shoulders easing just enough to be noticed. "I worry I'm teaching her the wrong lesson," she said. "That endurance looks like approval."
Dhriti leaned back, folding her arms. "You're teaching her how to stay standing," she said. "Approval is optional."
Artemis felt a flicker of irritation. The words scraped at something she hadn't named.
Dhriti tapped the tin closed. "I don't defend men," she said. "I don't condemn them either. I defend choices. Day by day. That's all I trust."
Leto nodded slowly. "She wants certainty."
"Everyone does," Dhriti replied. "Children just ask for it louder."
They shared a brief look—one that carried years of disagreement, grief, and affection without needing any of it spoken. Artemis shifted her weight, suddenly aware she was intruding on something not meant for her.
Dhriti stood, sliding the tin back onto the shelf. "She'll hear what she's ready to hear," she said. "Until then, let her be angry."
"And if it hardens her?" Leto asked.
Dhriti met her gaze. "Then we keep living anyway."
Artemis stepped back before she could be noticed. The conversation left a strange taste behind—no comfort, no instruction, just the weight of things that had happened and continued to happen. She didn't agree with what she'd heard.
But she couldn't dismiss it either.
And that—more than any argument—made her angry all over again.
The evening unraveled the way it always did—slowly at first, then all at once. The fan clicked as it changed speed. The radio shifted stations on its own, settling into a familiar tune. Dinner simmered, its smell filling the house until Artemis felt crowded by it.
She paced.
Not the restless pacing of boredom, but the sharp, measured steps of someone trying to outrun a thought that wouldn't loosen its grip. What she'd overheard earlier clung to her like heat—explanations instead of excuses, endurance instead of certainty. It felt unfair. Dangerous.
Dhriti noticed first. She always did. She said nothing, just slid a plate toward Artemis when the food was ready.
Artemis ignored it.
Leto waited. When Artemis didn't sit, she spoke—too softly, too carefully. "Eat something."
"I'm not hungry."
"You are," Leto said, then stopped herself from saying more.
The pause stretched. Dhriti continued serving, unbothered, humming under her breath. The normalcy pressed on Artemis harder than anger ever had.
"You're both pretending," Artemis said suddenly.
Leto looked up. Dhriti did not.
"Pretending what?" Leto asked.
"That this is fine," Artemis snapped. "That standing around talking about 'choices' changes what people do."
Dhriti set the spoon down. "No one said it does."
"That's what you meant," Artemis said, turning on her now. "You talk like if you just live with it long enough, it stops being wrong."
Dhriti finally faced her. "I talk like someone who has lived with it," she said evenly.
"That doesn't make it right."
"No," Dhriti agreed. "It makes it real."
The word hit harder than Artemis expected. Her chest tightened. The anger surged to cover it.
"You think you understand," Artemis said, voice rising. "You think because you survived something, you get to tell everyone else how to feel about it."
Leto stood. "Artemis—"
"No," Artemis cut in. She turned back to Dhriti, words tumbling faster now, sharper, crueler than she intended. "You're just used to it. That's all. You let it happen so often it stopped bothering you."
The room went very still.
Dhriti didn't raise her voice. She didn't move. "That's not true," she said.
Artemis scoffed. "Then why didn't you stop it? Outside. Earlier."
Dhriti's gaze didn't waver. "Because not every wrong ends cleanly," she said. "And because you don't always get to be the one who fixes it."
Artemis felt something crack. The words came out before she could stop them, ugly and unfair. "Then maybe you shouldn't talk like you know better."
Silence followed—thick, heavy.
Leto's face tightened. "That was unnecessary."
Artemis spun toward her. "So now you're taking her side."
Leto didn't answer right away. When she did, her voice was tired. "I'm asking you to stop hurting people because you're hurting."
That was the worst thing she could have said.
Artemis turned away, throat burning, anger collapsing into something she refused to name. She hated that she'd crossed a line. Hated that part of her knew it.
And hated most of all that she couldn't take the words back.
Night settled over the house like a held breath. The radio had been turned off. The fan still turned, but slower now, its rhythm uneven. Artemis sat on the edge of the bed in the back room, hands clenched together so tightly her knuckles ached. The words she'd thrown earlier kept circling back, sharper each time they returned.
No one came to correct her.
That was worse than being scolded.
From the other room came the faint sounds of life continuing—plates stacked, water running, a cupboard opening and closing. Dhriti moved with deliberate quiet, not tiptoeing, not slamming anything either. Just existing. Leto helped for a while, then stopped. Artemis could picture it without seeing: her mother leaning against the counter, shoulders sagging, too tired to pretend she wasn't hurt.
She waited for anger to return. It didn't. What came instead was a tight, hollow feeling under her ribs.
The door creaked softly. Leto stepped inside, not looking at Artemis at first. She straightened a blanket that didn't need straightening, picked up a book Artemis hadn't opened. The small, ordinary motions felt heavier than shouting would have.
"You crossed a line," Leto said at last.
Artemis didn't answer.
Leto didn't push. She sat on the chair near the window, facing away, giving Artemis the choice to speak or not. Outside, men's voices drifted past—low, unremarkable, fading as quickly as they came. Artemis noticed them and hated that they no longer sparked immediate rage.
"I'm not asking you to apologize," Leto continued, voice subdued. "I'm asking you to sit with what you said."
Artemis swallowed. Her throat burned. "She deserved it," she muttered, even as the conviction slipped.
Leto closed her eyes briefly. "No," she said. "She didn't."
Silence stretched again. The fan ticked. Somewhere, a door shut gently.
Artemis stared at the floor. Images pressed in uninvited: Dhriti's steady gaze, the way she hadn't flinched. The absence of retaliation. It felt like standing at the edge of something and realizing there was no one there to push you back.
"I didn't mean all of it," Artemis said finally. The admission felt like tearing something loose.
"I know," Leto replied.
That was it. No reassurance followed. No comfort wrapped around the moment. Leto stood, paused at the door, then left the room as quietly as she'd entered.
Artemis lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. The anger she relied on felt dull now, blunted by the weight of consequences that weren't loud or dramatic. No one hated her. No one chased her away.
They had simply gone on.
And in that quiet, Artemis felt something shift—not understanding, not acceptance, but the unsettling awareness that her words mattered even when they didn't explode.
She closed her eyes, wishing the certainty would come back as easily as the anger once had.
They left early.
The house was quieter than usual, the kind of quiet that comes from decisions already made. Dhriti moved through the kitchen with practiced efficiency, packing food into containers Artemis hadn't asked for and would pretend not to want. Leto stood nearby, checking nothing in particular, her attention divided between the clock and the back room where Artemis waited.
Artemis emerged last, bag slung over one shoulder. Her eyes flicked briefly toward Dhriti, then away again. The anger from the night before had dulled, leaving behind a tight, uncomfortable awareness she didn't know how to shake.
Dhriti handed Leto a small parcel. "For the road," she said. "And for when she says she isn't hungry."
Leto took it with a faint smile. "She always does."
"I always am," Artemis muttered.
Dhriti's mouth curved, just slightly. "That too."
They stood there for a moment that stretched longer than necessary. Not awkward. Weighted. Leto reached out and squeezed Dhriti's arm—brief, firm. A gesture that carried more than words would have.
"Don't disappear," Dhriti said.
Leto snorted softly. "I never do."
"That's not what I said."
Leto met her gaze, something weary and grateful passing between them. "I'll write."
"You'd better," Dhriti replied. "I like knowing where my people are."
Artemis watched this exchange from the side, unease stirring again. The certainty she clung to had no place here. There was no argument to win, no authority to rebel against. Just connection she wasn't part of.
Outside, the street had already come alive. Men walked past carrying bags, laughing, arguing about nothing. Artemis noticed them—and noticed herself noticing. The reaction came slower this time, frustration replacing fury.
As they walked away, Dhriti didn't follow. She stood in the doorway, arms folded, watching until they turned the corner. She didn't wave.
Leto exhaled once they were out of sight. The release was small, but real. She adjusted the strap on Artemis' bag without asking.
"We're going somewhere quieter," she said.
Artemis nodded stiffly. She didn't ask where. Control had already slipped; knowing the destination wouldn't give it back.
India receded behind them—not as a lesson learned or a truth accepted, but as a place that had unsettled her in ways she hadn't expected. The anger she brought with her hadn't vanished. It had just lost its sharpest edge.
That frightened her more than hatred ever had.
Because hatred was simple.
And simplicity, she was beginning to realize, was no longer something the world was willing to offer her.
Omaha, New Zealand
The air felt different the moment they stepped outside. Cooler. Cleaner. It moved instead of pressing down, carrying the smell of salt and something green Artemis couldn't name. The sky seemed wider here, stretched thin and pale, as if it had more room to be what it was.
They didn't rush. No crowds funneled them forward. No voices overlapped until meaning blurred. The road curved away toward the coast, and beyond it, water broke against rocks in an easy, patient rhythm.
Artemis slowed without realizing she'd done it.
Leto noticed. She always did. She didn't comment.
They walked along the edge of the path, the ground uneven underfoot. Grass bent with the wind, then righted itself again. Men passed them—joggers, a couple carrying boards, someone calling to a friend farther down the beach. Artemis tracked each one automatically, waiting for the familiar spark of anger.
It came late. Smaller. Like a match struck against damp stone.
She frowned, unsettled by the delay.
"This is quiet," she said finally.
Leto nodded. "That was the idea."
"That won't change anything."
"No," Leto agreed. "It just gives you room."
Artemis scoffed, but the sound lacked bite. She stared out at the water instead, watching the waves break and reform without force. Nothing demanded her attention here. No one leaned too close. No voices crowded her head.
She didn't relax. Not fully. But the tension in her shoulders loosened enough for her to feel it slipping.
They reached a low rise overlooking the shore and stopped. Leto sat on a rock, stretching her legs. Artemis remained standing, arms crossed, scanning the beach again. Men laughed somewhere behind them. A child shouted. A gull wheeled overhead, indifferent.
Nothing happened.
That was the problem.
The anger Artemis relied on felt misplaced here, like armor worn in the wrong climate. She kept it on anyway, jaw tight, waiting for the world to justify it.
"Don't wander too far," Leto said.
Artemis glanced at her. The instruction wasn't sharp. It wasn't worried. Just practical.
"I won't," she replied, surprised at herself.
She walked a few steps closer to the water, boots sinking slightly into sand. The sound of the waves filled her ears, drowning out everything else. Men existed here too—moving, talking, living—but they didn't press. They didn't intrude.
Artemis stood there longer than she meant to.
The resistance was still there. Coiled. Ready. But for the first time, it felt tired—like something held too tightly for too long.
She turned back toward Leto, irritation flickering as she recognized the shift.
This place wasn't changing her mind.
It was wearing her down.
The morning came in pale bands of light, slipping through the curtains and settling on the floor like something tentative. Artemis woke before Leto and lay still, listening. Wind moved through the trees outside. Waves broke in a steady rhythm she hadn't learned to ignore yet. No horns. No shouting. No overlapping voices demanding attention.
She sat up slowly, waiting for the familiar surge of readiness—the tightening in her chest, the reflexive anger that sharpened her senses. It arrived late again, dulled at the edges. That unsettled her enough to make her scowl.
Outside, the beach was already awake. A few people walked along the shore, spaced far enough apart that their paths never crossed. Artemis lingered at the edge of the sand, boots still on, eyes tracking movement out of habit. A man passed with a dog, nodding once without slowing. Another jogged by farther down, focused on his own breath. They existed near her without claiming any part of her space.
She waited for the moment when one of them would break the unspoken line.
None did.
Leto joined her after a while, carrying two cups. She handed one over without comment and sat on a low driftwood log, staring out at the water. Artemis took the cup, more out of reflex than hunger, and held it between her palms.
A group approached farther down the beach—three men, loud in a way that grated. Artemis' shoulders tightened. She stepped back a pace, already bracing. The men veered naturally, their path bending away without anyone needing to say a word. Their laughter faded as they moved on.
Artemis frowned. She hadn't moved quickly enough for it to be avoidance. She hadn't challenged them into giving her space. It had simply… happened.
She felt foolish for having prepared for a fight that never came.
"You saw that," she said, unable to keep the edge from her voice.
Leto nodded. "I did."
"They didn't—" Artemis stopped, frustration knotting her words. "They didn't do anything."
Leto didn't answer. She sipped her drink, letting the quiet do what talking couldn't.
Artemis kicked at the sand, irritation flaring. Respect without confrontation felt wrong. Unsatisfying. It left her with nothing to push against, nothing to prove.
She walked closer to the water, watching it pull back and surge forward again. The boundary held every time—firm, predictable, unmoved by her presence. She could stand at the edge without being swallowed.
Artemis hated how much that image fit.
The resistance was still there, coiled tight. But it no longer felt sharpened by constant threat. It felt worn thin by the effort of staying ready when readiness wasn't required.
She turned back toward Leto, annoyance flickering when she realized she didn't want to leave yet.
That, more than anything else, frightened her.
The beach had filled a little by midday—not crowded, just occupied. Families settled on towels farther down, a couple arguing quietly near the rocks, a few men wading into the water without ceremony. The rhythm of it all had become familiar enough to dull her edge, and she hated that familiarity most of all.
She stepped closer.
Not by accident. Not because she drifted. She walked toward a cluster of people near the shoreline, boots sinking into sand still damp from the tide. Her shoulders squared, senses sharpened. This was what she knew how to do: test the space, brace for the inevitable correction.
A man looked up as she approached. Middle-aged, sunburned, distracted. He noticed her proximity and shifted without comment, angling himself away to give her room. No glare. No remark. Just adjustment.
Artemis slowed, thrown.
She took another step—closer than she normally would. Close enough to feel intrusive. The man glanced again, hesitated, then stepped back entirely, muttering a brief apology that sounded more reflex than meaning.
"I didn't—" he began, then stopped, already moving away.
Artemis stood there, heat rushing to her face. She hadn't said anything. She hadn't demanded space. She hadn't been threatened.
She had been… accommodated.
Leto watched from a distance, leaning against a low fence. She didn't intervene. She didn't call Artemis back. She let the moment exist exactly as it was—awkward, unfinished.
Artemis' chest tightened. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. There was no justification for anger here, no proof to cling to. The familiar narrative slipped through her fingers, leaving her exposed to something worse: uncertainty.
She turned sharply and walked back toward Leto, irritation sparking.
"They moved," she said, almost accusingly.
Leto nodded. "You looked like you wanted space."
"I didn't ask for it."
"You didn't have to."
That answer didn't satisfy her. It felt like losing ground without a fight.
Artemis kicked at the sand, then stopped. The movement felt childish, and she hated that too. "This place is wrong," she muttered. "It doesn't make sense."
Leto studied her for a moment. "It doesn't have to," she said. "You're allowed to notice without deciding what it means yet."
Artemis looked back at the water. The tide crept in and retreated again, leaving clear lines in the sand—boundaries drawn and erased without drama.
She had crossed a line and nothing had punished her for it.
The resistance inside her shifted, tightening not with rage, but with effort. Holding onto certainty here felt like gripping something smooth and heavy, slowly slipping no matter how hard she squeezed.
Artemis stepped back from the shoreline and sat down hard beside Leto, arms folded tight. She didn't look at her mother.
She wasn't ready to change her mind.
But she was beginning to realize that resisting no longer came naturally.
It didn't stay quiet forever.
The afternoon thinned into a brittle kind of brightness, the sun sharp against the water. Artemis wandered along the edge of the beach while Leto sat farther back, half-watching, half-resting. The ease of the morning lingered—too smooth, too accommodating. Artemis hated how quickly she'd started to expect it.
Voices rose near the path behind her. Not loud at first. Just careless.
A group had gathered by the benches—young men, restless, bored. Their laughter carried, edged with something off. Artemis felt it before she understood it, the old tightening returning with unwelcome familiarity. She slowed, listening without meaning to.
One of them said something that drew another laugh. A glance followed—brief, appraising. Not threatening. Not respectful either. The kind of look that measured and moved on.
Artemis' shoulders squared automatically. There it was. Proof returning like a bitter relief.
She stopped, waiting for it to escalate.
It didn't.
A woman pushing a stroller passed between them and the group, her presence cutting the moment in half. One of the men muttered something under his breath—annoyed, dismissive—but another elbowed him sharply. The comment died unfinished. The laughter shifted, losing its edge.
Artemis watched, unsettled.
The wrongness had been real. So had the correction. No heroics. No confrontation. Just a boundary enforced sideways, without ceremony.
She glanced back toward Leto. Her mother was already watching—not alarmed, not distant. Present.
"They said something," Artemis said when she reached her.
Leto nodded. "I heard."
"And you're just… fine with that?"
"No," Leto replied. "I'm realistic about it."
Artemis frowned. "That's the same thing."
"It isn't," Leto said quietly. "Being aware doesn't mean giving up. It means choosing where to spend your strength."
Artemis looked back toward the benches. The group had shifted, interest already moving elsewhere. The moment had passed without exploding into something she could point at and condemn.
"That's worse," Artemis muttered. "It means it can happen and disappear like it never mattered."
Leto considered her. "It mattered," she said. "Just not enough to own the whole day."
Artemis sat heavily in the sand, anger flaring and then stalling. The old certainty tried to rise—this is why I'm right—but it didn't fit cleanly anymore. The wrong hadn't been ignored. It hadn't been indulged either.
It had been handled.
She hated how unsatisfying that felt.
The resistance inside her tightened again, but it no longer burned. It weighed. Holding it together took effort now, constant and dull.
Artemis stared out at the water, jaw clenched. The world wasn't proving her wrong.
It just wasn't letting her be completely right anymore.
The tide was lower by late afternoon, leaving long bands of wet sand that reflected the sky like dull mirrors. Artemis walked along them slowly, boots leaving dark prints that faded almost as soon as they appeared. She kept her eyes on the water, but her attention drifted back toward the benches again, to where the earlier tension had surfaced and dissolved.
People moved around it now—families packing up, a couple shaking sand from towels, a man jogging past with earbuds in. The group of young men was still there, but quieter, their energy dispersed. One of them argued with another in low tones; a third wandered off toward the path. Nothing dramatic. Nothing neat.
A woman with a clipboard approached them, speaking calmly. Artemis couldn't hear the words, only the tone—firm without being sharp. One of the men shrugged, annoyed, but he listened. Another nodded, embarrassed. The interaction ended quickly, almost anticlimactic.
Artemis stopped walking.
No one had been chased away. No one had been shamed into spectacle. The moment didn't become a story anyone would retell later. It simply… closed.
She felt oddly cheated.
Leto came to stand beside her without comment. They watched together as the woman checked something off and moved on, already focused elsewhere. The beach resumed its rhythm, the interruption absorbed without leaving a mark.
"That's it?" Artemis asked.
Leto didn't answer immediately. She followed the woman's path with her eyes. "That's often how it looks," she said. "When it works."
Artemis frowned. "No one paid for it."
"They adjusted," Leto replied. "Sometimes that's the point."
Artemis kicked at a shallow pool, ripples breaking the reflected sky. "It feels like letting them off."
"It feels like not turning everything into a battlefield," Leto said.
Artemis bristled, then hesitated. She replayed the moment in her head—the look on the man's face when the clipboard appeared, the way his shoulders had tightened. It hadn't been fear. It had been awareness. The uncomfortable kind.
"They didn't get away with it," Artemis said slowly.
"No," Leto agreed. "They were reminded."
The word sat strangely in her chest. Reminder implied something already known, not a rule imposed from outside. It implied choice.
Artemis looked back at the water. The resistance inside her shifted again, no longer spiking in response to threat. It reorganized itself, searching for a shape that fit this version of the world—one that corrected without spectacle, that spread responsibility thin instead of pinning it to a single face.
She didn't like it.
But she couldn't deny it existed.
The sun dipped lower, light softening. Artemis turned away from the shoreline and walked back toward Leto without comment. She sat beside her, close enough that their shoulders nearly touched.
She didn't say she was tired.
She didn't have to.
They packed without discussion.
Leto folded clothes on the bed, neat stacks forming and reforming as she reconsidered what they'd need next. Artemis watched from the doorway, arms crossed out of habit rather than defiance. The room smelled faintly of salt and clean fabric, the window cracked open to let the air move.
Normally, this was where it happened.
The question.
The protest.
The sharp insistence on knowing why.
Artemis felt it rise—and stall.
She told herself she didn't care where they were going. That it didn't matter. But the truth sat heavier than indifference: she was tired. Not the physical kind. The kind that came from holding a position long after it stopped giving anything back.
Leto paused, glancing over her shoulder. She waited.
Artemis said nothing.
The silence stretched, unfamiliar. Leto didn't fill it. She returned to packing, slower now, careful not to turn the quiet into a challenge.
They walked outside together once the bags were ready. The path curved away from the beach, grass bending underfoot. Men passed them—some nodding, some absorbed in their own conversations. Artemis noticed them and let the noticing pass through her without gripping it.
Leto stopped near the car. She rested a hand on the door, hesitating just long enough for Artemis to register the moment as an opening.
"Anywhere is fine," Artemis said, the words coming out flatter than she expected.
Leto turned, surprise flickering across her face before she masked it. "Are you sure?"
Artemis shrugged. "It's all the same."
It wasn't. They both knew that. But the argument that would usually follow never arrived. Artemis leaned against the car, eyes on the horizon, jaw set—not in anger, but in refusal to explain herself.
Leto nodded once and opened the door.
As they drove, the coastline fell away behind them. The road stretched ahead, empty in long, forgiving lines. Artemis watched the scenery change—water to trees to open fields—without marking the transitions as losses or victories.
Her resistance was still there. She felt it, coiled and ready. But it no longer surged to meet every decision. It waited now, conserving itself.
That frightened her.
She preferred anger. It burned clean. This felt like erosion—slow, invisible, inevitable.
Leto glanced at her once, then back to the road. She didn't comment. She didn't reach out. She let the quiet stand as it was, trusting it not to break.
Artemis closed her eyes and let the movement lull her, the road carrying them forward without asking permission.
For the first time since this chapter began, she didn't fight the direction.
She didn't accept it either.
She simply let it happen.
The work was simple. That was the point.
They spent the morning helping an older couple a short walk from where they were staying—nothing official, nothing framed as volunteering. Just lifting crates, rinsing sand from equipment, carrying things from one place to another because there were hands available. Artemis hadn't been asked directly. Leto had agreed, and Artemis had followed without comment.
She took a crate when it was passed to her. It was heavier than it looked. She adjusted her grip and carried it across the yard, set it down where the woman gestured, and went back for another. No one praised her. No one corrected her. The task existed whether she participated or not.
Men worked alongside her—quiet, focused, older than the ones on the beach. They spoke when necessary and not when it wasn't. Space was negotiated without words: a step back here, a pause there. Artemis noticed it all, the way she always did, but the noticing didn't escalate into readiness. It stayed practical.
She wiped sweat from her forehead and reached for another crate.
The woman thanked her, brief and sincere. Artemis nodded once, unsure what to do with gratitude that didn't demand anything in return.
Leto worked nearby, sleeves rolled up, movements steady. She didn't hover. She didn't check on Artemis more than anyone else. The equality of it pressed gently, insistently. Artemis was neither protected nor tested. She was simply included.
By midday, the work wound down. The couple offered water. Artemis took it without thinking, drank, and felt the small relief spread through her chest. She realized then how long she'd been bracing for nothing.
A man stepped aside to let her pass, apologizing when their paths nearly crossed. Artemis nodded and moved on. The interaction didn't linger. It didn't echo.
She sat on the low wall and watched the rest of the work finish. The resistance inside her shifted again—not loosening, not tightening. Settling. Like something that had learned it wouldn't be needed every moment.
Leto joined her, handing over a piece of fruit. Artemis accepted it automatically, then paused, surprised at herself. She ate anyway.
No one asked her what she thought about any of it.
That, more than anything, kept the day intact.
They walked back in the afternoon light, quiet stretching comfortably between them. Artemis didn't feel lighter. She felt… less strained. The difference was subtle, but it mattered.
The world hadn't demanded anything from her today. She'd done things anyway.
And the resistance, for once, hadn't been the thing carrying her forward.
The invitation was small enough to be missed.
They were sitting on the low steps near the water when it came—someone asking if Artemis wanted to help untangle a fishing line snagged around a post. No pressure. No expectation. Just a question offered and left hanging.
Artemis hesitated.
Her body leaned forward before her mind caught up. She stood, took two steps, and then stopped. The resistance flared—not sharp, not angry, but instinctive. Connection required proximity. Proximity invited expectation. Expectation led to disappointment or demand.
"I'm fine," she said, the words arriving late and thin.
The person nodded and turned away without comment, already moving on. No irritation. No insistence. The ease of it unsettled her more than refusal would have.
Artemis sat back down harder than necessary, irritation flickering at herself. She watched the task continue from a distance—hands working patiently, the line loosening inch by inch. A man laughed quietly when it finally came free. Someone thanked someone else. The moment closed without her.
She told herself she preferred it that way.
Leto noticed the shift beside her—the tension returning like a reflex—but didn't ask. She stared out at the water, letting the horizon hold her attention. The choice not to comment felt deliberate. Artemis hated how visible that made her hesitation feel.
"I almost went," Artemis muttered.
Leto glanced at her, expression neutral. "I saw."
"And?"
"And you didn't," Leto said. "That's allowed."
The permission landed awkwardly. Artemis frowned. "You're not going to say anything?"
"I just did."
Artemis picked at a loose thread on her sleeve, jaw tight. The world here kept offering her exits that didn't slam shut when she ignored them. It was exhausting to keep refusing without the fuel of outrage.
A breeze picked up, carrying salt and the distant sound of waves breaking. Men and women moved past them in loose patterns—talking, working, laughing—without forming the lines Artemis expected. The resistance inside her strained, searching for something solid to brace against.
She stood again, abruptly, and walked a few steps away—far enough to reclaim distance, close enough to remain present. The compromise irritated her.
Artemis looked back once, catching Leto's eye. Her mother hadn't moved. She hadn't followed. She hadn't turned away either.
That steadiness made Artemis' chest ache.
She returned to the steps and sat, shoulders hunched, anger simmering at nothing in particular. The near-connection lingered like an itch she couldn't scratch—unresolved, unfinished.
She hadn't crossed the line.
But she'd seen it.
And knowing where it was made pretending it didn't exist a little harder than before.
It happened later, when no one was watching for it.
The afternoon had thinned into a soft, slanted light. The beach grew quieter as people drifted away in small groups, the rhythm easing into something unclaimed. Artemis walked along the edge of the path, hands in her sleeves, mind busy with the familiar work of scanning and counting. She told herself she was just stretching her legs.
A child struggled near the rocks, tugging at a plastic bucket wedged awkwardly between stones. The tide crept closer, nudging the waterline up with patient insistence. The child pulled harder, frustration tipping into panic.
Artemis slowed.
She didn't like children. Not really. They were unpredictable, loud, and demanded attention she didn't want to give. She took another step, meaning to pass by—and stopped. The resistance flared, then hesitated, uncertain what it was meant to protect against here.
The bucket slipped free suddenly, sending the child backward. Artemis moved before she decided to. She caught the bucket with one hand and steadied the child with the other, quick and efficient.
"Careful," she said, the word clipped.
The child blinked, then nodded, clutching the bucket with renewed determination. A woman called out from a short distance away, relief obvious even before she reached them.
"Thank you," the woman said, breathless.
Artemis handed the bucket back and stepped away immediately, already turning. "It was stuck," she muttered, as if that explained everything.
The woman smiled anyway and gathered the child close. Artemis didn't wait for more. She walked back toward the path, irritation flaring at how fast her pulse still raced.
She hadn't meant to help.
She hadn't weighed it or justified it. She hadn't braced for anything afterward. The action had come and gone without asking permission.
Leto saw her return, eyes narrowing slightly—not in suspicion, but recognition. She didn't comment. She didn't smile. She shifted her weight and continued watching the water.
Artemis sat down beside her, jaw tight. The resistance inside her stirred, late and dissatisfied. It searched for a reason to reassert itself and found none that fit.
No one had praised her. No one had turned the moment into a lesson. It hadn't become a story she could either reject or cling to.
It had simply happened.
That was what unsettled her.
She stared out at the water, irritation simmering without direction. Helping hadn't softened anything inside her. It hadn't erased anger or clarified belief. It had just… bypassed it.
Artemis clenched her hands, annoyed at herself for noticing the absence of argument where one usually lived.
She didn't look at Leto.
She didn't need to.
The resistance was still there—coiled, alert. But for the first time, it hadn't been the thing that moved her.
And that realization lingered, quiet and unavoidable, long after the tide shifted again.
The thought arrived without warning and refused to leave.
Artemis noticed it first while lying awake, the room washed in pale moonlight, the window cracked just enough to let the sound of waves drift in. Her body was tired in an honest way—muscles sore, eyelids heavy—but her mind stayed alert, turning over the day with the same precision she used to scan a crowd.
She replayed the moment by the rocks. The child. The bucket. The way her body had moved before she decided to let it. No argument had preceded it. No justification followed. The resistance had arrived late, like a guard who'd missed the signal.
She frowned into the dark.
Men are not one thing.
The sentence formed unbidden, clean and uncomfortable. She didn't like it. It felt unfinished, too broad to be useful, too narrow to be satisfying. She tried to sharpen it—some men are bad, many men are careless, systems fail women—phrases she could grip and wield.
None of them fit the day she'd lived.
In the morning, she watched people from the edge of the path. A man lifted a child onto his shoulders, laughing when the child squealed. Another argued with a woman over directions, irritation flaring and fading just as quickly. Someone else held a door without looking to see who followed. The actions overlapped, contradictory and ordinary.
Artemis tracked them all, irritation simmering.
She wanted a rule. A single line she could draw and defend. But the world kept offering her clusters instead—patterns with exceptions, behavior shaped by place and moment. It felt slippery, unreliable. It required attention instead of certainty.
That cost more.
Leto walked beside her in silence, letting the morning stretch. Artemis knew her mother noticed the change—the quieter steps, the longer pauses—but she also knew Leto wouldn't name it. Naming made things real. Real things demanded decisions.
Artemis wasn't ready for that.
They stopped near the water. The tide had come in farther overnight, smoothing away yesterday's lines in the sand. New ones formed as the waves pulled back, temporary and precise.
The resistance inside Artemis shifted again, not tightening, not loosening. Reorienting.
Men are not one thing didn't mean men are safe. It didn't mean nothing bad happens. It meant something far more irritating: that she would have to look each time. Decide each time. Stay present instead of hiding behind a single answer.
She hated how much work that sounded like.
Artemis turned away from the water and walked back toward the path without comment. The thought followed her, unwelcome but persistent, settling into the space where certainty used to sit.
She didn't accept it.
But she didn't reject it either.
And that, she realized with a tight knot in her chest, might be the most dangerous place of all.
The change showed itself in small refusals.
Artemis noticed them as absences first—the moments where she didn't tense, didn't catalogue exits, didn't rehearse what she would do if something went wrong. They were brief, easy to miss, but once she saw them she couldn't stop seeing them. The resistance was still there, coiled and alert, yet it no longer filled the entire space inside her. It shared it now with something else: attention.
She walked the path alone while Leto waited near the water. The distance wasn't defiance; it was permission. Artemis took it cautiously, aware of how easily freedom could turn into exposure. People passed—some close, some not—and she adjusted without bracing, stepping aside when needed, holding her ground when it felt right. No rules guided her. Only judgment.
That unnerved her more than fear ever had.
A man nearly collided with her at a bend, distracted by a phone. He startled, apologized quickly, and moved on. Artemis stood there a beat longer than necessary, irritation flickering and then dissolving. She hadn't been endangered. She hadn't been proven right or wrong. The moment didn't demand a conclusion.
She exhaled and kept walking.
The resistance inside her shifted again, responding to this new pattern. It wasn't a wall anymore. It was a tool—heavy, familiar, sometimes useful, sometimes not. Carrying it required choice. Setting it down, even briefly, felt like a risk she hadn't agreed to take.
She returned to Leto's side without comment and sat, knees drawn up. The wind tugged at her sleeves. The water moved as it always did, indifferent to her reckoning.
Leto glanced at her once, then back to the horizon. No questions. No praise. Artemis felt a flash of irritation at how visible her quiet had become—and then a strange gratitude for the space it was given.
"I'm still not changing my mind," Artemis said, the words emerging as if to reassure herself.
Leto nodded. "I know."
The simplicity of the answer left no room to argue. Artemis frowned, then looked away. The part of her that had once defined herself by resistance alone felt unmoored. If she wasn't the girl who refused, who was she becoming?
Not someone trusting. Not someone forgiving. Someone watching. Someone choosing when to step in and when to step back. Someone who would have to carry the weight of judgment instead of hiding behind certainty.
That felt dangerous. It also felt real.
Artemis tightened her arms around her knees, eyes fixed on the water. The resistance remained—shaped now, not blunted. It no longer defined her entire outline, but it was still something she claimed as hers.
She wasn't ready to put it down.
But she was beginning to understand that it wasn't the only thing she was carrying.
They left at dawn.
The sky was thin and colorless, the world not quite awake yet. Artemis stood near the edge of the overlook while Leto loaded the last bag into the car. The water below was calm, stretched flat and pale, as if it were holding its breath along with her.
She tried to inventory what she was taking with her.
Not memories—that felt too neat. Not lessons—no one had taught her anything she hadn't fought first. What remained sat heavier and less cooperative: the sense that the world refused to stay simple no matter how hard she pressed against it.
Artemis crouched and dragged her fingers through the sand. It slipped away immediately, lines collapsing as soon as she drew them. She frowned and tried again, slower this time. The line held for a few seconds longer, then softened and disappeared.
She didn't try a third time.
Behind her, the car door closed with a quiet thud. Leto came to stand beside her, close enough that Artemis could feel her presence without being crowded. They looked out at the water together, neither speaking.
Men walked along the far edge of the beach—small shapes at this distance, indistinct. Artemis noticed them, as she always did. The familiar readiness stirred, then settled. No surge. No flare. Just awareness, sharp but no longer screaming.
The resistance was still there. She felt it clearly. It hadn't been dismantled or disproven. It hadn't apologized for itself. It remained part of her, shaped by what she'd endured and what she still refused to forget.
But it wasn't alone anymore.
Artemis straightened and brushed the sand from her hands. She glanced once more at the shoreline, at the place where the waves kept redrawing their edges without complaint. The image lodged somewhere deep, unwelcome and persistent.
Leto touched her shoulder briefly. Not to guide. Not to comfort. Just to signal that it was time.
Artemis nodded and walked back to the car. She climbed in without argument, without asking where they were going next. The road would decide that soon enough.
As they pulled away, the coastline fell back and flattened into distance. Artemis watched it recede until it was nothing more than a pale line against the horizon.
She wasn't calmer.
She wasn't kinder.
She wasn't convinced.
But the certainty she'd once carried like a weapon no longer fit cleanly in her hands. It shifted when she tried to grip it too tightly, demanding attention instead of obedience.
Artemis leaned her head against the window and closed her eyes, the hum of the road steady beneath her.
She was still resistant.
She just wasn't untouched anymore.
And that, she knew with a quiet, uneasy clarity, was exactly how the next change would begin.

Kyoto, Japan
Kyoto received them without resistance.
The train slowed into the station with a measured sigh, doors opening in orderly sequence. People stepped off and on without jostling, movements precise and unhurried. Artemis stood just behind Leto, bag slung over one shoulder, eyes tracking everything at once—the spacing between bodies, the absence of raised voices, the way no one needed to push to be heard.
It unsettled her.
They walked through the station and out into narrow streets where the air smelled faintly of rain and wood. Bicycles passed without warning bells. A shopkeeper bowed to a passerby. Men moved through the space with quiet awareness, adjusting their paths a fraction to avoid contact, never quite looking at her long enough to be measured.
Artemis waited for the familiar spark—the tightening in her chest, the reflex that told her where to stand and how to brace.
It didn't come.
She frowned and slowed her pace, testing the moment. A man stepped aside instinctively, giving her room without comment. Another passed close enough that she felt the brush of air, then was gone, attention already elsewhere.
Nothing pressed.
"This place is… quiet," Artemis said at last.
Leto nodded. "It listens before it moves."
That answer irritated her. It sounded like meaning where none was needed. Artemis stopped near a low wall, pretending to adjust her bag while she recalibrated. Quiet didn't mean safe. Order didn't mean kind. She knew this. She had learned it the hard way.
And yet—her body hadn't followed the lesson.
They crossed a small bridge, water sliding beneath them in smooth, uninterrupted lines. The city didn't demand reaction. It didn't challenge her vigilance or reward it. The lack of friction made her feel exposed, as if she were walking without armor and no one had noticed.
She tried to summon anger—just a flicker, enough to ground herself.
It arrived late, thin and unsatisfying.
Artemis' jaw tightened. She picked up her pace, irritation rising at the delay. She didn't like having to wait for herself. Anger was supposed to be immediate, reliable. It had always been.
Leto glanced at her, reading the tension without naming it. She didn't slow or speed up, simply matched Artemis' stride and kept moving.
They passed a group of men speaking softly near a storefront. One looked up briefly, nodded in acknowledgment, and returned to the conversation. No assessment. No lingering interest.
Artemis felt a pulse of something sharp and misplaced—anger searching for a target that refused to exist.
She clenched her hands inside her sleeves and kept walking.
Kyoto did not resist her.
And for the first time since this change began, Artemis realized with a chill that she didn't know how to move through a world that wouldn't push back.
The thought followed her down the street, quiet and persistent:
If nothing challenges me… what am I supposed to be ready for?
She didn't like the question.
Not at all.
Kyoto made its expectations felt without announcing them.
Artemis noticed it in the way people paused before crossing paths, in the small shifts of posture that prevented collision before it became a possibility. No one raised their voice to claim space. No one needed to. The city moved on agreements that were never spoken aloud.
She hated how quickly she began to notice the pattern.
At a narrow street corner, she stopped short, deliberately slowing. A man approaching from the opposite direction adjusted instantly, stepping aside without irritation, without acknowledgement. Another followed, doing the same. The exchange was clean, efficient, over before it could be catalogued.
Artemis' shoulders tensed. She hadn't moved to assert herself. She hadn't challenged them into giving way. It had simply… happened.
That felt wrong.
She walked on, eyes scanning for the familiar tells—carelessness, entitlement, the subtle pressure she'd learned to recognize before it surfaced. Instead, she found attention without intrusion. Awareness without interest.
A shopkeeper spoke quietly to a customer, voice even. Two men laughed softly nearby, their conversation folding in on itself instead of spilling outward. The noise never rose high enough to demand response.
Artemis felt the absence like a weight.
"You're counting again," Leto said, not looking at her.
Artemis stiffened. "I always count."
"Yes," Leto replied. "But you're listening harder than you need to."
That annoyed her more than if Leto had been wrong. Artemis stopped at the edge of the street, pretending to study a display while she sorted the feeling burning behind her eyes.
"I don't trust this," she said finally.
Leto joined her, gaze unfocused, as if she were watching the street rather than the people in it. "You don't have to."
"That's not what I meant." Artemis' voice dropped. "It feels like I'm missing something."
Leto considered her. "Or like nothing is demanding anything from you."
Artemis scoffed. "That's worse."
They walked again. The street narrowed further, the space compressing without becoming crowded. Artemis waited for irritation to spike, for her body to brace itself as it always had.
It didn't.
She felt herself adjusting instead—mirroring the pauses, timing her steps to avoid friction. The realization struck her hard enough to make her falter.
She wasn't resisting.
She was adapting.
Artemis clenched her jaw and forced her pace forward, refusing the rhythm the city offered her. She brushed past a man intentionally, testing the boundary.
He startled, apologized reflexively, and stepped aside.
The interaction ended before it began.
The anger she expected to feel didn't arrive. What came instead was a sharp, rising discomfort that had nothing to do with him.
Artemis pressed her hands together, nails biting into her palms.
The rules here weren't enforced.
They were assumed.
And without a rule to push against, she felt something unsteady open inside her—an unease she couldn't name, only recognize.
Fear didn't arrive yet.
But the ground beneath her certainty had started to tilt.
The moment should have been simple.
They were crossing a small courtyard near a temple, gravel crunching softly underfoot. A group approached from the opposite side—tourists, distracted, their formation loose and careless compared to the flow Artemis had been learning to read. One of the men drifted out of line, path intersecting hers at an angle that was too close, too unplanned.
This was where it usually happened.
The tightening.
The flare.
The clean, familiar surge that told her how to move.
Artemis felt nothing.
She slowed, confused, waiting for her body to catch up. The man looked up at the last second, startled, and adjusted sharply, murmuring an apology as he stepped back. The near-collision dissolved into the gravel without friction.
Artemis stopped walking.
The delay hit her a breath later—cold and unmistakable.
It wasn't that anger hadn't come. It was that it had arrived after the moment had passed, thin and misplaced, like an echo that didn't belong to the sound that caused it. Her chest tightened, not with rage, but with something closer to alarm.
She pressed her lips together and forced herself to keep moving, but the rhythm was gone. Each step felt slightly off, her timing no longer aligned with the space around her.
"You froze," Leto said quietly, once they were clear of the path.
"I didn't," Artemis replied too quickly.
"You stopped."
Artemis shook her head, irritation flaring at the wrong target. "I was thinking."
"That's new," Leto said—not teasing, not accusing. Just observing.
Artemis bristled. "I always think."
"Yes," Leto agreed. "But you didn't react."
That word landed hard.
Artemis looked back toward the courtyard. People moved through it smoothly, the moment already forgotten. She tried to replay it in her mind, searching for the spark she'd missed, the instinct that should have guided her.
It wouldn't come back.
She felt exposed, like someone who'd reached for a weapon that wasn't there anymore.
"I don't like this place," Artemis muttered.
Leto studied her, then nodded once. "You don't like not knowing what comes next."
Artemis didn't answer. The truth of it pressed too close to something she wasn't ready to touch. She set her jaw and walked faster, as if speed might force her instincts to reassert themselves.
They passed under the shadow of a gate, the air cooler beneath it. Artemis deliberately stepped closer to the next group she saw, testing herself. The people adjusted automatically, their movements smooth, unbothered.
Again—no reaction.
Her breath came shallow now, irritation curling inward. The problem wasn't them. The problem was that her body no longer moved ahead of her mind.
That delay—small, almost invisible—terrified her more than any confrontation ever had.
Because hesitation wasn't something she knew how to fight.
And she had no idea how many more moments like this it would take before the fear caught up to her completely.
Artemis spent the rest of the afternoon watching herself.
Not the city. Not the people. Herself.
They walked along a narrow canal where the water moved slowly, reflecting the wooden facades in fractured lines. Tourists drifted in and out of the path, their movements loose, uncoordinated compared to the rhythm Artemis had begun to recognize. She tracked every approach, every angle, waiting for the reflex to return.
It didn't.
Instead, something else took its place—calculation. She adjusted her steps consciously, measured distance, anticipated movement the way one plans rather than reacts. It worked. Too well. The absence of friction made her stomach twist.
This wasn't how it was supposed to feel.
She slowed, then stopped, pretending to study the water. Her reflection wavered back at her, broken and reforming with each ripple. She frowned at it, unsettled by how unfamiliar her own stillness felt.
"Are you tired?" Leto asked, stopping beside her.
Artemis shook her head. "No."
"That was quick."
"I'm fine," she said, sharper than she meant to.
Leto didn't press. She rested her arms on the low railing and watched the water instead. The silence stretched, unchallenging and persistent.
Artemis turned away from the canal and walked ahead again, deliberately placing herself closer to passing bodies. She wanted the surge back—the clarity, the certainty that came from knowing exactly when to brace.
A man passed too near. Artemis felt the brush of fabric. She waited for the jolt.
Nothing.
Her breath caught. She took another step, heart thudding now, not with anger but with something colder. She tried to force the feeling, dredging up memories that had once been enough to ignite it.
The response came sluggish, dull and distant.
She clenched her hands inside her sleeves, nails biting into her palms. This is wrong, she told herself. I don't lose this. I don't.
Leto glanced back at her, concern flickering briefly before being masked. "You're pacing yourself," she said.
"I don't need to," Artemis snapped.
Leto raised an eyebrow. "You didn't used to."
That stung more than accusation. Artemis opened her mouth to retort, then stopped. The words she wanted relied on a certainty she couldn't quite reach anymore.
They continued walking, the canal giving way to a broader street. Artemis felt the weight of attention shift inward, her awareness folding back on itself. She was no longer preparing for others.
She was preparing for her own hesitation.
The realization made her throat tighten.
If she couldn't trust her instincts, then every moment required decision. Judgment. Responsibility. There was no shield in that—only exposure.
Artemis swallowed and kept walking, posture rigid, senses strained.
The fear still hadn't fully surfaced.
But she could feel it gathering, patient and inevitable, waiting for the moment she could no longer pretend this was temporary.
The evening settled softly over Kyoto, lantern light spilling into the street in warm, deliberate pools. The shift from day to night felt rehearsed, as if the city had practiced it countless times and no longer needed to think about it. Artemis walked beside Leto, her steps slightly too quick, her shoulders held tight.
She waited for Leto to say something.
Usually, this was where it happened—guidance, correction, reassurance framed carefully so it didn't feel like instruction. Artemis had learned to brace for it, to reject it before it could take root.
Nothing came.
They passed a small restaurant, the murmur of voices low and contained inside. Men and women sat close together, their movements relaxed, unguarded. Artemis noticed herself noticing, irritation flickering at the familiarity of the scan.
Still, no surge followed.
She slowed, then stopped altogether. Leto took a few steps more before realizing Artemis wasn't beside her. She turned, studying her daughter with quiet attention.
"Well?" Artemis asked, unable to keep the edge from her voice.
Leto waited a beat. "What do you want me to say?"
Artemis faltered. The question landed wrong, pulling the ground out from under the irritation she'd prepared. "That this is strange," she said. "That something's off."
"It is," Leto replied evenly.
"And?"
"And you've noticed."
Artemis stared at her. "That's it?"
Leto nodded once. "That's enough for now."
The answer left no room to argue against. Artemis turned away sharply and resumed walking, jaw clenched. The absence of correction felt heavier than disapproval ever had. Silence wasn't neutral—it demanded attention. It forced her to sit with the discomfort she'd hoped Leto would name and contain for her.
They crossed another bridge, water dark beneath them now, reflecting fragments of light that refused to stay whole. Artemis leaned against the railing briefly, pressing her palms to the cool wood.
"You're not helping," she muttered.
Leto joined her, gaze on the water. "I'm not stopping you either."
"That's not the same thing."
"No," Leto agreed. "It isn't."
Artemis exhaled sharply, frustration curling inward. She wanted Leto to tell her this was a phase, that her instincts would snap back into place if she waited long enough. She wanted proof that nothing fundamental had changed.
Leto offered none.
They stood there, the city breathing around them, unbothered by Artemis' quiet crisis. The world didn't slow to accommodate her uncertainty. It moved on, steady and precise.
Artemis pushed off the railing and walked ahead again, heart beating faster now. Leto followed at an unhurried pace, close enough to be present, far enough to avoid crowding.
The fear crept closer, no longer held at bay by irritation or denial.
If Leto wasn't stepping in, then this wasn't something that could be corrected.
It was something Artemis would have to face on her own.
And that realization tightened her chest in a way no external threat ever had.
Tokyo pressed in without touching her.
The station pulsed with movement—streams of bodies flowing in practiced lanes, footsteps aligning and separating with near-mathematical precision. Artemis stood just inside the threshold, senses flaring out of habit, mapping the angles, counting exits. This was density. This was where vigilance was supposed to matter.
Nothing snagged.
People passed close enough for her to feel the warmth of their sleeves, the rush of air as they slipped by. No elbows. No stares that lingered too long. Adjustments happened before contact, a choreography so ingrained it barely registered as choice.
Artemis took a step forward, then another. The crowd parted a fraction, then sealed behind her, leaving no trace she'd been there.
Her pulse climbed anyway.
She tried to provoke the reflex—slowing suddenly, shifting her path at the last second, moving against the flow. The response was immediate and impersonal: a half-step aside, a pivot of shoulders, a murmured apology from someone who hadn't actually done anything wrong.
Still no surge.
The noise swelled and fell around her, contained within invisible bounds. Announcements chimed overhead. Shoes scuffed. Laughter flickered and vanished. The city demanded attention without offering a target.
Artemis' breathing went shallow. She focused on keeping pace, on not being swallowed by the rhythm she hadn't agreed to follow. Every successful adjustment felt like a small failure—proof that she could move through this without the tools she'd trusted.
She reached the platform edge and stopped, heart hammering. The crowd flowed around her as if she were a stone in a stream, pressure diverting cleanly without complaint.
"This should be chaos," she muttered.
Leto stood beside her, steady, eyes forward. "It's controlled," she said. "There's a difference."
Artemis clenched her jaw. Control was supposed to be hers.
The train arrived in a smooth rush of air. Doors opened. People exited and entered with the same unspoken rules. Artemis stepped inside, forced by proximity more than choice. She stood, gripping the overhead strap, surrounded on all sides.
Her body waited for the jolt.
It didn't come.
The absence roared louder than noise. Her muscles tensed anyway, readying for a threat that refused to appear. She felt ridiculous—overprepared in a world that didn't need her readiness.
At the next stop, a man shifted to give her space without looking at her. Another adjusted his stance to avoid brushing her arm. The courtesy felt clinical, stripped of meaning. It didn't care who she was or what she believed.
Artemis closed her eyes for a beat, fighting the tightness in her chest.
If anger didn't rise here—packed in, pressed on all sides—then when would it?
The thought landed heavy and unwelcome.
Tokyo didn't challenge her.
It rendered her vigilance unnecessary.
And standing there, suspended between stops, Artemis felt the first true edge of fear cut through the noise—not fear of them, but fear of what it meant that she could be here, surrounded, and still not know what she was supposed to be ready for anymore.
Artemis didn't trust the quiet inside her.
They exited the station into a narrower street, the city compressing again into controlled lanes of movement. Neon signs buzzed softly overhead, their light reflecting off glass and pavement. Tokyo at night was louder than Kyoto, brighter, sharper—and still it refused to meet her where she stood.
She slowed deliberately.
Not out of caution, but calculation. She let herself drift closer to the edge of the sidewalk, nearer to passing bodies than she preferred. This was a test. A controlled one. She needed the reflex back—the spike, the clarity that told her exactly where she stood in relation to everyone else.
A man brushed past, close enough that the fabric of his sleeve grazed her arm.
Artemis waited.
Nothing happened.
Her chest tightened, irritation flaring too late, directionless. She tried again, angling herself into the path of oncoming pedestrians, forcing proximity. The crowd compensated instantly, paths shifting with mechanical ease. Apologies surfaced and vanished without weight.
She stopped walking altogether, breath shallow now. The anger should have been there—sharp, grounding, familiar. She searched for it like one might search for a misplaced object, patting down memory and muscle alike.
Come on, she thought, jaw clenched. Now.
She replayed old moments in her mind, images that had once been enough to light the fuse. The response flickered weakly, a shadow of what it used to be. It felt staged, like repeating lines that no longer belonged to her.
"This isn't working," she muttered.
Leto glanced back, concern surfacing before she masked it. "What isn't?"
Artemis shook her head sharply. "Nothing."
But it wasn't nothing. The failure sat heavy in her chest, spreading cold. Anger wasn't just an emotion—it was orientation. It told her where the edges were. Without it, everything felt too open, too undefined.
She pressed her hands together, nails biting into her palms, trying to force sensation through pain if nothing else. The city continued around her, indifferent to her internal struggle. Men passed, women passed, lives intersected and separated without pause.
Her breath came faster now, the beginnings of panic edging in. She hated it immediately. Panic was useless. Panic meant losing control.
"I should feel something," she said, the words slipping out before she could stop them.
Leto slowed, studying her. "You are," she said carefully.
"That's not what I mean." Artemis' voice dropped. "I need the other thing."
Leto didn't answer. She didn't have to. The absence of reassurance made the truth settle harder.
Artemis turned away and resumed walking, pace uneven. The effort of summoning anger exhausted her more than the anger ever had. Each failed attempt deepened the unease curling in her stomach.
She wasn't numb.
She was misaligned.
And the fear that followed wasn't sudden or sharp—it was slow, creeping, and absolute.
If she couldn't call the anger back when she needed it, then she didn't just risk being wrong.
She risked being undefended.
That thought stayed with her long after the lights blurred into distance, heavy enough to make her shoulders ache.
They stopped at a quiet side street where the noise dropped away all at once, as if the city had folded in on itself. The sudden stillness made Artemis' skin prickle. She leaned against a vending machine, the low hum vibrating faintly through her shoulder, grounding and insufficient at the same time.
She closed her eyes and tried again.
Not theatrically. Not angrily. Carefully.
She searched for the familiar sequence—the tightening first, then the surge, the clean alignment of body and intent. The thing that had always come when she needed it, no matter where she was or who stood in front of her.
It didn't respond.
The absence felt deliberate now, like something withholding itself.
Her stomach twisted. This was no longer irritation or discomfort. This was fear, finally arriving in full, cold clarity. Fear not of the men passing at the end of the street, not of the city pressing in—but of the quiet inside her where certainty used to live.
She opened her eyes and watched a group walk past the corner. Their footsteps faded. Nothing followed.
"I used to know," she said quietly.
Leto turned toward her, expression open, careful. "Know what?"
"When to be ready," Artemis replied. The admission felt like pulling something loose. "It was instant. I didn't have to think."
Leto nodded once. She didn't soften the moment by reframing it. "And now?"
Artemis swallowed. "Now I have to check."
The words landed harder than she expected. Checking meant doubt. Doubt meant delay. Delay meant exposure. Her breath shortened again, chest tight, the edges of panic brushing closer.
She pushed off the machine and took a few steps, then stopped, suddenly unsure where she was going. The city around her felt unchanged—orderly, predictable, indifferent. The danger wasn't out there.
It was the gap between impulse and action.
She wrapped her arms around herself, nails pressing through fabric into skin. The pain helped, but only a little. Fear curled tighter, whispering questions she didn't want to hear.
What if this doesn't come back?
What if this is permanent?
What if I need it and it isn't there?
Leto watched her without stepping closer, giving Artemis the space to spiral without interruption. That restraint hurt almost as much as interference would have.
"I don't trust this," Artemis said again, but the words sounded thinner now.
Leto answered softly, "You don't trust yourself."
The truth of it knocked the air from her lungs.
Artemis turned away sharply, jaw clenched, eyes burning with something dangerously close to tears. She hated that the fear had found a shape. She hated that it had a name.
Because now that she could see it clearly, she couldn't pretend it belonged to the world anymore.
It belonged to her.
And standing there in the narrow Tokyo street, with the city moving calmly around her, Artemis felt the terrifying realization settle in:
She had built herself around a certainty that no longer obeyed her.
And she didn't know who she was supposed to be without it.
Artemis compensated.
If the reflex wouldn't answer, then she would replace it with attention—constant, exhausting attention. She straightened, forced her shoulders back, and began to watch harder than she ever had before. Every step was measured. Every face catalogued. Every sound evaluated for meaning it might not have.
The city didn't reward the effort.
They walked through another stretch of Tokyo streets, busier now, the night deepening. People flowed around them with the same effortless order, their paths intersecting and separating without friction. Artemis tracked it all, her mind running faster than her body, searching for patterns she could control.
Her head began to ache.
She adjusted her pace again, staying just behind Leto, then drifting ahead, then falling back. None of it settled the tightness in her chest. The vigilance felt hollow, like gripping a blade without an edge.
"You're hovering," Leto said quietly, not accusing.
Artemis bristled. "I'm paying attention."
"Yes," Leto replied. "Too much."
Artemis scoffed and moved ahead again, irritation flaring briefly before dissolving into fatigue. She hated the weakness in that—the way anger refused to sustain itself, leaving only effort behind.
At a crosswalk, she stopped short, heart racing for no reason she could point to. The light changed. People moved. She moved with them, half a step late.
That delay echoed louder now.
Her breath shortened. The world felt sharper at the edges, like everything might cut her if she misjudged the angle. She clenched her hands, nails biting into skin again, grounding herself through pain because nothing else worked.
This was supposed to make her safer.
It didn't.
The more she monitored herself, the less room there was to breathe. Each decision demanded justification. Each moment required calculation. The freedom that anger had once given her—clean, immediate, unquestioned—was gone.
She slowed again, dizziness flickering at the edges of her vision. Leto noticed immediately and stopped, turning toward her fully this time.
"Sit," she said, firm but calm.
Artemis hesitated, then obeyed, lowering herself onto a low concrete barrier. The city continued around them, unbothered by her sudden stillness. A man glanced at her, concerned, then looked away when Leto nodded slightly.
The exchange was small. Unremarkable.
It shouldn't have mattered.
It did.
Artemis stared at the ground, chest heaving now, the fear pressing in hard enough to make her hands tremble. Overcorrection hadn't restored control.
It had stripped it further.
"I can't keep doing this," she muttered, the admission barely audible.
Leto crouched in front of her, not touching, just present. "Then don't," she said.
Artemis shook her head sharply. "I don't know how to stop."
The truth settled heavy and inescapable.
Without her instinct to rely on, vigilance became a cage of her own making. The more she tried to hold herself together, the more brittle she felt—like one wrong movement would shatter whatever fragile balance she'd forced into place.
Fear had fully arrived now, no longer creeping or distant.
It sat in her chest, solid and undeniable.
And for the first time, Artemis understood that fighting it the way she always had was only making it worse.
They didn't go far after that.
The street narrowed into a quieter lane, storefronts shuttered, light thinning into pale reflections on wet pavement. Artemis walked beside Leto now, close enough that their steps almost aligned. She hated the proximity and needed it at the same time.
Her hands still trembled.
She tried to steady her breathing, counting in her head the way she always had when control threatened to slip. The numbers tangled, losing their rhythm halfway through. Her chest felt too tight, like the air had grown heavier without warning.
"This is stupid," she said, the words brittle. "Nothing's happening."
Leto glanced at her. "Something is."
Artemis shook her head hard, as if she could dislodge the feeling. "I'm not in danger."
"I know."
"That's the problem." The admission came sharper than she meant. "I don't know what to do when I'm not."
They stopped beneath an awning as a light drizzle began to fall. The sound softened the city, muting footsteps and distant voices. Artemis leaned against the wall, suddenly exhausted, every muscle taut with effort.
Fear pressed in fully now—not sharp, not panicked, but dense and suffocating. It didn't give her a direction to move or a target to fixate on. It simply existed, heavy and undeniable.
She closed her eyes and tried one last time to summon anger. She reached for it deliberately, the way she would reach for a weapon she'd carried too long to imagine being without.
Nothing answered.
Her throat tightened. For a moment, she thought she might cry, and the possibility terrified her more than the fear itself. She swallowed hard and forced her eyes open, staring at the rain-darkened street.
"I don't trust this," she whispered. "I don't trust me."
Leto stood close, not touching. "You don't have to decide anything right now."
"That's easy for you to say." Artemis' voice wavered despite her effort to keep it steady. "You still know who you are."
Leto didn't argue. She simply said, "I know who you are."
That wasn't comforting. It was pressure.
Artemis pushed off the wall and took a step forward, then another, testing her balance. The fear didn't recede. It followed, constant and patient. She realized with a sick twist that this was the peak—there was no surge left to come, no escalation waiting to break it open.
This was it.
She was standing in the middle of a city that refused to threaten her, inside a body that refused to react the way it used to. The old equation—danger equals anger, anger equals safety—no longer solved anything.
Her certainty had failed her.
The fear wasn't teaching her a lesson. It wasn't offering clarity.
It was simply showing her the cost of not knowing who she would be when the anger didn't arrive.
And as the rain deepened and the city moved on around them, Artemis stood there, breathing shallow and uneven, understanding one thing with terrible clarity:
Whatever came next, it wouldn't be protected by the person she used to be.
The fear didn't follow them onto the train the way Artemis expected it to.
She sat by the window, forehead resting lightly against the glass, watching the city blur into bands of color as they moved. Her body felt wrung out—muscles sore, joints heavy, the kind of fatigue that came from holding tension too long. The panic had burned itself down to embers, leaving behind a dull ache that was harder to name.
This was worse in its own way.
Fear, at least, had direction. It demanded response. What remained now felt empty, undefined, like the space left behind after something essential had been torn out.
Leto sat across from her, eyes on the darkened reflection in the window rather than on Artemis herself. She didn't ask questions. She didn't fill the quiet. The restraint felt deliberate, respectful—and infuriating.
Artemis flexed her fingers, then stilled them when she realized she was checking for tremors that weren't there anymore. Her hands were steady. Her breathing had evened out.
She should have felt relieved.
Instead, she felt hollow.
The train slowed at a station. People stepped on and off, the same practiced flow she'd come to expect. Artemis watched it distantly, no longer trying to test herself against it. The effort required to care felt too high. She let the world pass without engaging, and the world let her.
That mutual disengagement frightened her more than the fear had.
"What if it doesn't come back?" she asked suddenly, voice low.
Leto didn't pretend not to hear. "What?"
"The thing," Artemis said. "The way I used to be."
Leto considered her for a long moment. "Then you'll be something else."
The answer landed without force. No reassurance. No warning. Just fact.
Artemis turned back to the window, jaw tightening. Something else sounded too close to disappearance. She wanted to argue, to insist that there were things you didn't replace, only lost.
But the argument felt heavy, effortful. She didn't have the energy to hold it together.
The train emerged briefly above ground, the city opening into a stretch of dark sky and distant lights. Artemis watched it with the strange detachment of someone observing a place she might never return to—not because she couldn't, but because she wouldn't be the same person when she did.
Her thoughts drifted, unanchored. The fear no longer pressed at her chest, but it hadn't left either. It had settled somewhere deeper, quieter, waiting.
This wasn't resolution.
It was aftermath.
Artemis leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes, letting the movement carry her without resistance. For the first time since arriving in Japan, she didn't scan the space around her.
She scanned herself instead.
And in that inward turn, something shifted—not toward peace, but toward the uneasy awareness that fear wasn't the end of this change.
It was only the beginning of having to understand what came after.
Time blurred between places.
Airports, gates, the dull choreography of travel folded over Artemis without leaving impressions sharp enough to hold. She moved when prompted, followed signs, handed over documents, reclaimed her bag on the other side. The motions required attention, but not judgment. That, more than anything, let her breathe.
The fear stayed quiet.
Not gone. Quiet.
She noticed it in the way her thoughts circled without landing, in the way she watched people pass without attaching meaning to them. Men, women, families, individuals—faces flickered by, distinct and then gone. Artemis didn't test herself against them anymore. She didn't try to summon anything at all.
The effort felt unnecessary. And that scared her in a different way.
Leto walked beside her through the terminal, close enough to be present, far enough not to intrude. They spoke when required—logistics, directions, nothing that reached inward. The normalcy of it pressed gently, insistently, against Artemis' awareness.
She realized, dimly, that she wasn't bracing.
That should have felt like progress. It didn't. It felt like standing in unfamiliar shoes—functional, but not yet hers.
On the plane, Artemis took the window seat again. The ground fell away beneath them, lights thinning into patterns that meant nothing from this height. She rested her head back and watched the wing cut through cloud, steady and unbothered.
Fear had peaked in Japan. She knew that now. What remained wasn't panic or dread, but a low, persistent unease that hummed beneath everything else.
The question wouldn't leave her alone.
If I don't react the way I used to… what am I reacting as?
She didn't have an answer. She didn't try to invent one. The absence of anger made even speculation feel exposed, like guessing without armor.
Leto shifted in her seat beside her. Artemis glanced over, then away again. There was something she could ask—something about change, about whether this was temporary—but the thought of hearing an answer made her chest tighten.
Answers implied direction.
She wasn't ready for that.
They landed in the early hours, the air different the moment they stepped outside. Softer. Familiar in ways Artemis hadn't anticipated. The smell of the sea carried on the breeze, subtle and unmistakable.
Greece.
The word settled in her chest with unexpected weight.
This wasn't relief either.
Familiarity didn't soothe the unease—it sharpened it. Whatever had shifted in Japan hadn't stayed behind. It had traveled with her, quiet and intact, crossing borders as easily as she had.
As they walked toward the waiting car, Artemis felt the distance from Tokyo close behind her, not as memory but as residue. Fear had cooled, yes.
But it hadn't resolved.
It had simply made space.
And standing there on familiar ground, Artemis realized that whatever understanding waited for her next would not come from escape.
It would come from facing what this quiet had replaced.
Greece felt wrong in a way Japan never had.
The road curved along the coast, the sea flashing between breaks in stone walls and low trees. Artemis knew this light—the way it settled, the way it made everything look sharper than it was. She'd grown up inside it. It should have fit like memory fits. Instead, it pressed against her skin, too intimate, too aware.
She stepped out of the car and stood still, listening.
The sounds were familiar: waves against rock, distant voices carrying without effort, the hum of a place that didn't hurry. Men moved through the street with the ease of people who belonged to it. Artemis noticed them automatically—and then noticed that her body didn't brace.
That absence felt louder here.
In Japan, the quiet had been foreign. Here, it was personal.
She walked a few steps ahead of Leto, then slowed, unsettled by the way her feet knew where to go without instruction. This path. That turn. The small dip in the stone she'd once tripped over and learned to avoid. Her past moved beneath her without asking permission.
"I remember this," she said, half to herself.
Leto nodded. "You would."
Artemis frowned. "I don't feel like I should."
They reached the edge of the overlook, the sea opening wide and blue below them. Artemis rested her hands on the stone railing, staring out at the water. This place had once made her feel anchored—grounded in who she was, what she stood for.
Now it felt like a mirror she didn't recognize.
A man passed behind them, greeting Leto with a casual nod. Artemis tracked the movement, waited for the familiar tightening.
Nothing.
Her fingers curled around the stone. The lack of reaction made her feel careless, as if she were neglecting something essential. She replayed old moments in her mind—times when this place had sharpened her resolve instead of dulling it.
"You're quiet," Leto said.
Artemis didn't answer right away. "It's easier here," she said finally. "That's the problem."
Leto studied her, then looked back toward the sea. "Ease doesn't always mean safety."
"I know," Artemis replied, sharper than she intended. "I used to know that."
The words hung between them, heavier than accusation. Artemis straightened and stepped back from the railing, unsettled by how exposed she felt standing in a place that knew her so well.
Japan had taken something from her without asking.
Greece was showing her what it was.
And that recognition cut deeper than fear ever had.
Because whatever had changed wasn't tied to location or culture or distance.
It was tied to her.
Standing on familiar ground, Artemis felt the first clear edge of understanding begin to form—not as comfort or clarity, but as an unwelcome truth:
She could no longer hide behind the world to explain herself.
The silence that followed wasn't peaceful.
It was expectant.
And she had the uneasy sense that Greece would not let her leave until she faced what she'd brought back with her.
Artemis walked the path she used to take without thinking.
The stones were worn smooth in places, edges softened by years of footsteps and weather. She remembered running here once—barefoot, reckless, certain of her balance. Now she moved more carefully, watching her footing, aware of how easily a misstep could send her skidding toward the drop.
That awareness felt new. And wrong.
She stopped where the path narrowed, the sea visible between the rocks below. This had been a place of certainty once. A place where she'd stood tall, shoulders squared, convinced that vigilance alone could hold the world at bay. She remembered the weight of that confidence—how clean it had felt, how absolute.
She tried to summon it now.
The memory responded, sharp and vivid, but the feeling didn't follow. The certainty stayed lodged in the past, refusing to bridge the gap.
Artemis exhaled slowly, frustration stirring. "I used to know how to stand here."
Leto paused a few steps behind her. "You still do."
"That's not what I mean." Artemis glanced back, irritation flickering. "I didn't have to think about it."
Leto nodded once. "You trusted yourself."
The words landed heavier than expected. Artemis turned back toward the sea, jaw tightening. Trust implied reliability. Reliability implied something she could count on.
She wasn't sure she had that anymore.
A pair of men passed farther down the path, voices low, their presence unremarkable. Artemis tracked them automatically, then caught herself doing it. The habit felt exposed here, too visible against the backdrop of memory.
She hadn't always watched like this. Once, she'd simply been.
"That girl wouldn't hesitate," Artemis said quietly.
Leto joined her at the edge of the path, gaze following the line of the coast. "That girl didn't have your experiences."
"That girl had conviction," Artemis shot back.
"And certainty," Leto replied. "They're not the same thing."
Artemis stiffened, the distinction scraping against something tender. She turned away from the sea and continued along the path, steps quickening, as if motion might outrun the thought.
But Greece didn't allow distance. Every turn carried another memory—another version of herself she could no longer fully inhabit. The contrast pressed in, tightening her chest.
This place hadn't changed.
She had.
And the understanding that had begun to form earlier sharpened here, cutting through denial with uncomfortable precision: what she'd lost wasn't safety or vigilance.
It was the simplicity of believing that her reactions alone defined who she was.
The path widened again ahead, the tension easing slightly, but Artemis didn't feel relieved. Recognition without comfort settled into her bones, heavy and unavoidable.
She kept walking, knowing now that Greece wasn't offering answers.
It was asking her to measure the distance between who she had been and who she was becoming—and to sit with the difference, no matter how much she disliked it.
The town center hadn't changed in any way that mattered.
The same narrow streets curved inward toward the square. The same café stood at the corner, chairs stacked unevenly outside, their metal legs scraping softly as someone rearranged them. Artemis recognized the rhythm of the place immediately—the way voices carried, the way people paused mid-conversation to greet one another without breaking stride.
She remembered moving through this space with certainty.
Now, she moved like a guest.
A group passed close enough for her to hear fragments of conversation. A man laughed, sharp and sudden, then softened it into something quieter. Another adjusted his path to avoid colliding with her, nodding briefly in apology. Artemis noticed each action automatically—and then noticed that her response was no longer immediate.
There it was again.
The pause.
She stopped walking.
Leto continued a few steps before realizing Artemis wasn't beside her. She turned, waiting without comment.
"I see it," Artemis said finally.
Leto tilted her head slightly. "See what?"
"The difference." Artemis' voice was steady, but her hands curled into fists at her sides. "I'm not reacting. I'm deciding."
The word tasted strange. Deciding implied responsibility. It meant there was no instinct to hide behind, no automatic shield to raise when the world brushed too close.
Leto said nothing, and Artemis hated how much that space made room for the thought to expand.
She resumed walking, slower now. The realization followed her through the square, heavy and unrelenting. In Japan, the absence of reaction had felt like failure. Here, surrounded by familiarity, it felt like exposure.
She wasn't safer.
She was more visible to herself.
A man carrying groceries nearly bumped into her at a corner. Artemis stepped aside without thinking, then froze. The movement hadn't come from vigilance or anger. It had come from judgment—fast, quiet, unannounced.
She stared after him, pulse quickening.
"That wasn't instinct," she said.
Leto joined her again, gaze soft but attentive. "No."
Artemis swallowed. "It was me."
The understanding settled then—not as comfort, not as clarity, but as something unavoidable. Her fear in Japan hadn't been about men or crowds or space.
It had been about this.
If her reactions were no longer automatic, then every moment required choice. And choice meant accountability. It meant that when she stepped back or forward, it was because she had decided to—not because something inside her had done it for her.
She hated how adult that sounded.
"I don't like it," Artemis admitted.
Leto nodded once. "You don't have to."
That wasn't reassurance. It was permission to dislike the truth without rejecting it.
They reached the edge of the square and stopped. Artemis looked around, the town moving on as it always had, indifferent to her internal reckoning.
The understanding didn't make her feel wiser.
It made her feel unarmored.
And standing there in a place that remembered who she used to be, Artemis realized something she couldn't undo:
Her fear hadn't come from losing protection.
It had come from realizing that protection had quietly become responsibility.
The street they walked down next was quieter than the square, lined with low houses and uneven stone walls. Artemis remembered it from years ago—not for anything important, just because it had always been there. A place you passed through without thinking.
Now she thought about every step.
The understanding she'd reached in the square didn't settle into her comfortably. It followed her instead, close and insistent, changing the weight of ordinary things. She noticed how she adjusted her pace when someone approached, how she chose when to look up and when to look away. Each movement felt deliberate in a way that left no room to hide.
She missed the certainty of reaction.
A man stepped out of a doorway ahead of them, carrying a crate balanced awkwardly against his hip. Artemis registered the situation instantly—distance, trajectory, timing. She slowed, then stepped aside without pause. The man nodded in thanks and continued on.
The exchange was smooth. Efficient.
It also left her unsettled.
She hadn't reacted out of anger or instinct. She had assessed, chosen, acted. The responsibility of it pressed against her chest like a weight she hadn't agreed to carry.
"I don't like having to think this much," she said quietly.
Leto glanced at her, then back to the street. "You don't have to like it."
"That doesn't make it easier."
"No," Leto agreed. "It just makes it honest."
Artemis frowned, irritation flaring briefly before ebbing again. Even irritation felt harder to sustain now, like a spark that couldn't find dry ground. She kicked lightly at a loose stone and watched it skitter ahead of them, then disappear into the gutter.
They continued walking. The houses grew closer together, voices drifting from open windows—domestic, unguarded sounds. Artemis felt the urge to brace and resisted it, not because she felt safe, but because she knew now that bracing was a choice too.
That realization didn't calm her.
It made her hyperaware.
She slowed again, breathing carefully, the effort of constant decision wearing at her nerves. This was the cost she hadn't anticipated. Understanding hadn't simplified anything. It had complicated everything.
"You're not doing it wrong," Leto said, sensing the tension without looking at her.
Artemis shot her a glance. "That's not reassuring."
Leto nodded faintly. "I know."
They reached the end of the street and paused. Artemis leaned against the stone wall, eyes closed for a moment, gathering herself. The understanding was still there, solid and unmoving.
She could act without anger.
She could decide instead of react.
And she hated how exposed that made her feel.
When she straightened again, the tension hadn't vanished. It had settled into something more manageable—resentful acceptance rather than resistance. She wasn't at peace with it.
But she was carrying it.
And as they turned onto the next street, Artemis understood one more quiet, unsettling truth:
This wasn't a phase she could wait out.
This was a way of moving through the world she would have to learn how to survive.
The harbor smelled like salt and rust, familiar in a way that tugged at old memories Artemis didn't fully want. Boats rocked gently against their moorings, ropes creaking in a slow, uneven rhythm. She remembered coming here when she was younger—how the openness of the water had once made her feel sharp and awake, ready for anything that approached from any direction.
Now it only made her feel watched by her own thoughts.
They stopped near the edge of the pier. Men worked along the boats, movements practiced and unremarkable—hauling nets, checking lines, arguing quietly over something technical and unimportant. Artemis observed them automatically, cataloguing distance and posture, the way she always had.
The difference was what followed.
Nothing hardened inside her.
She waited for it, the familiar tightening that used to turn observation into armor. It didn't arrive. The choice not to harden felt conscious now, deliberate in a way that made her skin prickle. She could still do it—she knew that—but she didn't.
And that unsettled her more than if she had.
A man passed close behind them, carrying a coil of rope. Artemis sensed him, adjusted her stance without thinking, and let him pass. The movement was clean, efficient. It didn't cost her anything. It also didn't give her the sense of control she used to crave.
She frowned at the water, watching the distorted reflection of herself ripple and reform.
"I could still do it," she said suddenly.
Leto looked at her. "Do what?"
"Harden," Artemis replied. "I know how."
Leto nodded slowly. "Yes. You do."
Artemis' jaw tightened. "Then why don't I want to?"
The question hung there, unanswered. Leto didn't rush to fill the silence. She watched the harbor instead, letting the sounds of work and water carry on without commentary.
Artemis crossed her arms, irritation flickering—not at the men nearby, but at the absence of something she'd relied on for so long. Choosing not to harden felt like leaving a door unlocked, even if nothing was trying to come through it.
She hated how exposed that felt.
A shout rose briefly from one of the boats, sharp but not angry, then softened into laughter. The moment passed. Artemis noticed it, felt the reflex stir, and consciously let it settle again.
The effort surprised her.
Not hardening took work now.
She shifted her weight, restless. "This isn't safer."
"No," Leto said. "It's different."
Artemis huffed softly, dissatisfied. Different didn't come with rules. Different didn't promise protection. It just asked her to remain present, moment by moment, without the comfort of automatic defenses.
She stared out at the open water, tension coiled but contained.
Understanding hadn't made her softer.
It had made her selective.
And standing there at the edge of the harbor, Artemis realized that the question she was asking herself now wasn't whether men could be trusted.
It was whether she could trust herself not to harden every time the world brushed against her.
She didn't know the answer.
But she knew she was choosing, again and again, not to default to the armor she'd worn for so long.
That choice didn't feel like peace.
It felt like standing still while everything else kept moving.
The market along the harbor had grown busier by midday.
Stalls crowded the narrow stretch of stone, canvas awnings flapping softly in the breeze. Voices overlapped in familiar rhythms—vendors calling out prices, customers negotiating without urgency, laughter surfacing and fading as easily as the tide. Artemis remembered this place too. It had always felt alive without being chaotic.
Today, it felt demanding.
She moved through the space slowly, aware of every adjustment she made. Each step was a choice now. Each pause carried intent. The understanding she'd reached followed close behind her, shaping how she navigated the press of bodies.
A man stepped backward suddenly from a stall, arms full, not looking where he was going. Artemis noticed in time and shifted aside, quick and clean. The movement cost her nothing physically.
Emotionally, it did.
The familiar surge never came. No flare of anger, no tightening that told her she'd been wronged by proximity alone. Instead, there was a thin, unsettling awareness of herself—of how easily she'd handled it without the defenses she'd once relied on.
She felt… exposed.
Another body brushed past her shoulder, this time unavoidable. Artemis stiffened reflexively, the urge to harden flashing bright and sharp. She held it back, jaw clenched, letting the contact pass without reaction.
Her chest tightened—not with fear, but with effort.
This was the cost she hadn't expected. Staying open required work. It demanded attention, restraint, and judgment all at once. Anger had been simpler. It had drawn clear lines and kept them drawn.
Now the lines blurred unless she redrew them herself.
"Watch it," someone snapped nearby—not at her, but at a vendor who'd knocked over a crate. The moment flared and fizzled out as quickly as it appeared. Artemis tracked it, waiting for the familiar pull to align herself against it.
It didn't come.
Instead, she felt the weight of standing in the middle of things without retreating into armor. The world brushed against her again and again, and each time she chose how much to let in.
By the time they reached the far end of the market, her shoulders ached with tension. She leaned against a low wall, breathing carefully, the noise washing over her in waves.
"This is harder," she admitted quietly.
Leto stood beside her, gaze sweeping the crowd. "Yes."
Artemis frowned. "You're not going to tell me it gets easier."
Leto shook her head. "Not today."
That honesty grounded her more than reassurance would have. Artemis closed her eyes for a moment, letting the sounds settle. The understanding she'd reached hadn't made her safer or calmer.
It had made her responsible.
When she straightened again, the fatigue remained—but so did the choice. She stepped back into the flow of the market without hardening, without retreating.
It wasn't victory.
It was endurance.
And for now, that was enough to carry her forward.
The path along the cliffs rose gently away from the harbor, the noise thinning with each step. The sea stretched wide and patient below, waves breaking in slow repetition against the rocks. Artemis welcomed the space—not because it felt safe, but because it allowed her to breathe without negotiating every movement.
She walked ahead of Leto again, not out of defiance, but because she needed to feel where her own edges were now.
The understanding she carried from the market hadn't faded. It had settled, heavy and persistent. Staying open took effort. Hardening took effort too. The difference was that now she had to decide which effort she was willing to make.
A man approached from the opposite direction, his stride uneven as he adjusted the strap of a bag slung over his shoulder. Artemis noticed him early, tracked his line, calculated distance. This time, she didn't step aside immediately.
She waited.
Not to challenge him. To feel the moment stretch just long enough to matter.
He noticed her at the same time, slowed, and shifted to give her space. No apology. No tension. Just an unspoken agreement reached without words. They passed each other cleanly, the space between them intact.
Artemis felt the difference immediately.
She hadn't hardened.
She hadn't yielded reflexively.
She had chosen her ground.
The realization steadied her more than anything had all day.
She stopped a few steps farther along the path and looked out over the water, heart beating evenly for the first time since the market. The choice hadn't cost her as much this time. It still required attention, but it didn't drain her in the same way.
Leto came to stand beside her, following her gaze. "You found your balance," she said.
Artemis shook her head. "I found a moment."
Leto smiled faintly at that.
They stood in silence, the wind tugging at their clothes, the sea indifferent below. Artemis replayed the exchange in her mind—not with judgment, but with curiosity. She hadn't needed anger to hold her space. She hadn't needed to withdraw either.
She'd stayed present.
The understanding sharpened, not into certainty, but into something usable. Maybe this was what it meant to live without armor—not unprotected, but attentive. Not hardened, but not yielding blindly either.
"I still don't like it," Artemis said.
"I wouldn't expect you to," Leto replied.
Artemis glanced at her, then back at the horizon. The world stretched out in front of her, unchanged and complicated. Men would still exist in it. So would moments that demanded choice.
She didn't feel prepared for all of it.
But standing there on the cliffside path, Artemis recognized that her fear had shifted shape. It was no longer about losing herself.
It was about learning where she was willing to stand.
That wasn't resolution.
But it was direction.
The afternoon drifted on without announcing itself.
They moved back toward the town along streets Artemis knew by heart—corners she could turn without looking, steps she could count without thinking. Familiarity used to make her sharper. Now it tested whether the understanding she carried could survive outside moments that felt staged by necessity.
She watched herself closely.
A cart rattled past, too close, and she stepped aside without stiffening. A voice rose briefly behind her—irritation flaring over nothing—and she glanced back, assessed, and moved on. Each response arrived without ceremony, the decision forming and completing itself before she could second-guess it.
That unsettled her.
The absence of struggle made it feel less earned, as if she were cheating something by not paying the emotional cost she'd grown used to. Anger had always demanded energy; this didn't. It simply worked.
She stopped near a low wall and leaned back, eyes following the line of the street. "I didn't think about it that time."
Leto slowed, then nodded. "No. You didn't."
Artemis frowned. "That doesn't mean it's gone."
"No," Leto agreed. "It means you're practicing."
Artemis pushed off the wall and resumed walking, irritation flickering briefly at the word. Practice implied repetition. Repetition implied habit. Habit implied permanence—and that thought tightened her chest.
She didn't want this to become automatic. She didn't want to replace one reflex with another and pretend it was choice.
A group passed them, laughing loudly, energy spilling outward in a way that would have once sharpened her focus. She noticed the rise, felt the old reflex stir faintly, and let it pass without gripping it.
That, too, felt like a choice.
The realization followed her down the street, heavier than the fear had been earlier. If this became habit, then she wouldn't get to decide each time. The burden would lighten—but so would the awareness.
She wasn't sure she wanted that.
"I don't want to forget," Artemis said suddenly.
Leto looked at her. "Forget what?"
"Why I learned to harden in the first place." Artemis' voice stayed steady, but her hands curled into fists. "I don't want this to turn into pretending it never mattered."
Leto didn't argue. "It won't," she said simply. "Not if you remember."
Artemis breathed out slowly, the tension easing just enough to let the words settle. Remembering wasn't the same as reacting. It didn't require anger. It required attention.
They reached the end of the street where it opened back toward the sea. Artemis paused, taking in the view—the water catching late light, the town humming behind them.
The understanding she carried hadn't resolved anything. It hadn't healed her or softened her edges.
But it had begun to repeat itself.
Not as instinct.
As habit.
And that realization, unsettling as it was, told her something important: this way of moving through the world wasn't temporary.
It was becoming something she would have to choose whether to keep.
The evening cooled the town without quieting it.
Lights flickered on in windows one by one, soft yellow spilling onto the street. The air smelled faintly of food and salt, familiar enough to be almost comforting. Artemis noticed the familiarity and felt the old reflex twitch—memory trying to assert itself as authority.
She didn't let it.
They walked without destination, following streets that bent and doubled back on themselves. Artemis let Leto set the pace this time, not because she needed guidance, but because she wanted to feel what it was like not to lead with tension.
It wasn't easier.
Her awareness stayed sharp, but it no longer leapt at every movement. She tracked people as they passed—men, women, couples, groups—but the tracking ended where it should, not spiraling into preparation. Each moment resolved itself without demanding escalation.
That restraint felt deliberate now. Chosen.
She hated how normal it was becoming.
A man stepped out of a doorway ahead of them, startled when he nearly collided with Artemis. He apologized quickly, embarrassed, and moved on. Artemis paused, the old anger flickering faintly before fading again. She stood there, unsettled by how little the moment asked of her.
She resumed walking without comment.
Leto glanced at her, reading the tension. "You're holding it carefully," she said.
"I don't trust it," Artemis replied.
"That's fair."
Artemis frowned. "You're not going to tell me it's good."
Leto shook her head. "No. I'm going to tell you it's yours."
The words settled heavy in Artemis' chest. Yours meant responsibility. It meant that whatever shape this understanding took next, it would belong to her—not to circumstance, not to location, not to someone else's behavior.
They reached a small overlook where the street dipped away toward the sea. Artemis stopped, resting her hands on the stone barrier, breathing in slowly. The water below reflected the last of the light, calm and indifferent.
"This isn't finished," Artemis said quietly.
Leto stood beside her, gaze steady. "No."
"And it's not going back."
"No," Leto agreed again.
Artemis exhaled, irritation flaring and fading in the same breath. The certainty she'd once relied on was gone. In its place was something narrower, more precise, and far more demanding.
She straightened and stepped back from the overlook, the understanding settling into her bones not as peace, but as direction. She would have to carry this forward—into new places, new encounters, new versions of herself.
Not because it was better.
But because it was real.
As they turned back toward the town, Artemis didn't brace herself the way she once would have. She didn't relax either.
She walked alert, deliberate, aware.
The questioning hadn't ended.
It had simply learned how to move with her.
Night settled fully by the time they reached the older part of town.
The streets narrowed, stone pressing close on either side, the lamps fewer and farther between. Artemis recognized this stretch immediately. It was the kind of place she would once have sharpened herself for without thinking—muscle memory snapping into place before the mind caught up.
She waited for that snap.
It didn't come.
Instead, she felt the understanding settle again, firm and unwelcome: nothing was going to move for her unless she chose how to move first. The absence of reflex didn't make the street safer. It made her more responsible for how she occupied it.
A pair of men approached from the far end, their voices low, indistinct. Artemis tracked them automatically, noting their pace, the way they walked side by side without urgency. The old armor stirred faintly, a suggestion rather than a command.
She didn't reach for it.
She shifted her path instead, angling just enough to keep distance without retreating. The adjustment was small, precise. When they passed, one of the men nodded briefly, more acknowledgment than apology, and continued on without slowing.
The moment closed cleanly.
Artemis felt the familiar urge to catalog it—to decide what it meant. She stopped herself. Meaning was no longer something she assigned afterward. It was something she chose in the moment.
They continued on. The town breathed around them, quiet but not empty. Doors closed. A radio played somewhere behind a wall. Footsteps echoed briefly, then faded.
"You're still watching," Leto said softly.
"Yes," Artemis replied.
"But you're not bracing."
Artemis frowned, considering. "I'm not leaving either."
Leto nodded, satisfied with that answer.
They reached a small square where the street widened again, tension loosening with the space. Artemis paused under a lamp, light catching in her hair, and felt the strange duality settle deeper: vigilance without hostility, awareness without armor.
She realized then that this wasn't something she could set down at the end of the day. It wasn't an exercise or a phase. It was a way of carrying herself that would follow her into sleep, into waking, into places that didn't announce themselves as dangerous or safe.
That thought made her chest tighten—not with fear, but with weight.
"I'm not putting it away," she said quietly.
Leto looked at her. "I know."
Artemis stepped forward again, shoulders squared—not hardened, not relaxed. Just present.
The night didn't test her. It didn't reward her either.
It simply let her pass.
And as they walked on, Artemis understood that whatever came next—Italy, America, the wider world—this was what she would be bringing with her.
Not certainty.
Not anger.
But a vigilance she chose to carry, even when she wished she didn't have to.
They cut through a small courtyard Artemis hadn't thought about in years.
It sat tucked between two rows of houses, stones worn smooth at the center where people had crossed the same path for generations. A fig tree leaned over the low wall, leaves rustling softly in the night breeze. Artemis slowed without realizing she had, the pull of memory stronger here than anywhere else they'd walked.
She used to come here when she needed to think.
Back then, thinking had been simple. You chose a position, hardened into it, and waited for the world to challenge you. Whatever came next would either prove you right or sharpen you further.
Now, the space felt narrower—not physically, but emotionally. The memories didn't align cleanly with who she was standing there as.
She stepped into the courtyard and stopped at the center, hands at her sides. The quiet pressed in, intimate and unhurried. A man's laughter drifted from a nearby house, followed by a woman's voice telling him to keep it down. Ordinary. Domestic. Untouched by her internal reckoning.
Artemis waited for irritation.
It didn't come.
She felt instead the weight of remembering how she used to occupy spaces like this—alert, closed, prepared to defend even against imagined threat. The armor had been heavy, but it had been clear. It told her exactly who she was supposed to be.
She didn't have that clarity anymore.
"This used to be easy," she said, more to the air than to Leto.
Leto stepped into the courtyard after her, stopping near the wall. "Easy doesn't mean light," she said.
Artemis exhaled slowly. "It meant I didn't have to carry it with me."
She shifted her weight, the stones cool under her boots. The vigilance she carried now felt different—less rigid, more demanding. It didn't lock her into place. It followed her, asking to be recalibrated constantly.
She hated how much attention that required.
A door opened at the far end of the courtyard. Someone stepped out, glanced briefly in their direction, then disappeared again. No judgment. No curiosity. Just a moment passing through another.
Artemis tracked it, then let it go.
She realized then that she wasn't nostalgic for who she'd been. She didn't want to return to that version of herself. What she missed was the simplicity of having a single answer to everything.
The understanding tightened around that truth.
Her anger hadn't protected her because it was right.
It had protected her because it was easy.
Artemis straightened, feeling the weight of that realization settle into her posture. She didn't feel relieved by it. If anything, it made the path ahead feel longer.
They left the courtyard quietly, Artemis casting one last glance back at the fig tree silhouetted against the light. Memory stayed with her, but it no longer dictated how she moved.
She carried it forward instead—another piece of the weight she was learning not to set down.
And as they turned back toward the main street, Artemis understood something she couldn't undo:
She wasn't losing herself.
She was losing the shortcut she'd relied on to survive.
Dawn found her awake before the light fully reached the hills.
Artemis stood at the edge of the road that climbed out of town, the stones still cool beneath her boots, the sky thinning from black to gray above the sea. The world felt paused here—not asleep, not yet awake—caught between states in a way that mirrored her too closely to be comfortable.
She breathed in slowly, measuring the air the way she now measured everything.
The understanding she carried hadn't loosened overnight. If anything, it had settled deeper, no longer sharp but dense, like something she would have to lift every day whether she wanted to or not. She felt alert without being tense, present without bracing.
That balance felt fragile.
A car passed on the lower road, engine quiet, headlights fading quickly into the distance. Artemis tracked it out of habit, then let her attention fall away once it was gone. The movement felt deliberate—not forced, not rehearsed.
She was choosing what to hold.
Leto joined her without sound, standing a step back so Artemis could keep her space. The gesture mattered more than any words would have. They watched the light shift together, the horizon sharpening slowly into color.
"I don't know how long this lasts," Artemis said finally.
Leto nodded. "You don't have to."
Artemis frowned. "That's not reassuring."
"No," Leto agreed. "It's just honest."
The road ahead curved out of sight, climbing toward places Artemis hadn't been yet. Italy. America. Names that carried weight without detail. She didn't feel ready for them. She doubted she ever would.
But readiness no longer felt like the requirement.
She stepped forward, then stopped, testing the motion. The old armor stirred faintly, reflex whispering that she should harden before moving into what she couldn't see. She let the whisper pass.
Not because she trusted the world.
Because she trusted herself to choose again when it mattered.
That distinction felt thin and vital.
"I won't forget," Artemis said, more to herself than to Leto.
Leto glanced at her. "You don't strike me as someone who does."
Artemis huffed softly, not amused, not angry. The understanding hadn't softened her. It hadn't forgiven anything. It had only clarified the shape of what lay ahead.
Not answers.
Responsibility.
She turned back toward town, the first light spilling fully across the rooftops now. Greece hadn't healed her or anchored her. It had simply shown her the distance between who she was and who she would have to be next.
That was enough.
As they walked back down the hill, Artemis carried the weight with her—not as burden alone, but as orientation. She didn't know what Italy or America would demand of her.
She only knew she wouldn't meet them the way she once would have.
And that knowledge, unsettled and incomplete, pointed her forward without pretending the path would be easy.
Morning arrived without ceremony.
Suitcases stood by the door, half-packed and slightly mismatched, the kind of disorder that came from movement rather than haste. Artemis watched Leto check them, her motions practiced, unhurried. The routine felt familiar—leaving had always been easier than staying.
This time, it didn't feel like escape.
Artemis lifted her bag and adjusted the strap, feeling the weight settle across her shoulder. It was light compared to what she carried inside, and the contrast made her lips press thin. She hadn't slept much, not because of fear, but because her thoughts refused to arrange themselves into anything that resembled rest.
Leaving Greece didn't feel like relief.
It felt like continuation.
They stepped outside together, the street already stirring with early movement. A man unlocked his shop across the way, glancing up briefly before returning to his work. A woman swept her doorway, the sound steady and rhythmic. Ordinary life asserting itself without pause.
Artemis watched, alert but unarmed.
She didn't brace. She didn't relax. She let the moments pass, measuring herself against them rather than against the people moving through them.
At the end of the street, she stopped and looked back once more. Not searching for closure. Not looking for reassurance. Just acknowledging the place for what it had given her—and what it hadn't.
"This isn't finished," she said quietly.
Leto nodded. "It wasn't meant to be."
Artemis exhaled, the tension in her shoulders easing just enough to let the words settle. Greece hadn't solved anything. It hadn't answered her questions or made the path ahead clearer. What it had done was strip away the last illusion that this change could be waited out.
She turned forward again.
The road stretched ahead, uncertain and demanding, but no longer abstract. Italy waited somewhere beyond it. America after that. Places that would test whether what she carried could hold under pressure—or whether she would reach for the armor again when the cost became too high.
She didn't pretend to know the answer.
As they walked toward the waiting car, Artemis felt the old reflex stir faintly, then settle again without command. The movement was almost automatic now—not instinct, but practice.
That unsettled her.
It also grounded her.
She climbed into the car and closed the door, the sound final without being definitive. The engine started. The town began to slide away, rooftops giving way to open road.
Artemis watched it go without regret or longing.
This wasn't an ending.
It was the moment she accepted that questioning wasn't a phase.
It was the ground she would be walking on from here forward—whether she liked it or not.
The road unwound ahead of them, pale under the morning light.
Artemis watched it from the back seat, eyes following the line where stone gave way to scrub, where familiar curves straightened into something less forgiving. Greece receded without ceremony. No moment marked its passing. No feeling announced itself as final.
That felt right.
She rested her head against the window and let the movement carry her. The weight inside her hadn't lightened since dawn. If anything, it felt more settled now—less sharp, more constant. Like something she would have to account for every day, the way one accounts for gravity.
Her thoughts drifted, not backward, not fully forward. Japan still sat somewhere in her awareness, not as memory but as origin. Greece pressed closer, not as comfort but as clarification. Neither place had solved anything.
They had only narrowed the question.
She flexed her fingers slowly, noting the absence of tension. No bracing. No hardening. Just awareness, steady and alert. The ease of it unsettled her again—not because it felt wrong, but because it felt repeatable.
That was the dangerous part.
If this became her default, then anger would no longer arrive uninvited. She would have to choose it. And choosing meant examining it. Justifying it. Carrying the consequence of it instead of letting it carry her.
She didn't like that.
She also didn't look away from it.
Leto shifted in the front seat, adjusting her posture, sensing without turning that Artemis was still awake. She didn't speak. Neither did Artemis. The silence between them wasn't heavy anymore. It was functional. Enough.
The car took a turn, the last glimpse of the sea vanishing behind a rise in the road. Artemis felt the loss register without pulling at her chest. She didn't reach for it. She didn't need to.
The understanding she carried didn't ask her to forgive the world or soften toward it. It asked something far less generous and far more difficult:
To remain present without certainty.
To act without the comfort of inevitability.
To let questions exist without demanding they resolve into answers.
Her jaw tightened briefly, irritation stirring and fading. She let it go. Not because it was wrong—but because it wasn't required.
As the road opened wider ahead, Artemis closed her eyes for a moment, not to rest, but to check herself. The awareness remained. The weight remained.
So did the question.
Not are men dangerous?
Not can I trust them?
But:
Who am I when I don't already know how to react?
She opened her eyes again, gaze steady on the road ahead.
That question didn't frighten her the way it had before.
It didn't comfort her either.
It simply stayed.
And as Greece disappeared fully behind them, Artemis understood that this—this ongoing, unresolved questioning—was not something she would grow out of before Italy or America or anything that followed.
It was something she would be bringing with her.
Not as armor.
As awareness.
And that was where this chapter ended—not with certainty, not with peace, but with a question she was no longer running from.

Presenting: "The Man-Understanding Goddess"
________________________________________
Italy did not feel foreign to her.
That, more than anything else, unsettled Artemis.
The air was warmer than Greece, softer around the edges, carrying the faint smells of stone, coffee, and something fried nearby. Voices drifted through the street in a language that felt familiar without being hers, rounded and expressive, alive with gestures. She walked among them with an ease that surprised her body even as her mind stayed alert.
Here, she was Diana.
Not Artemis of the Hunt. Not the daughter of Zeus. Not the goddess sharpened by old certainties. Just a woman moving through a city that had once reshaped her name and stories into something slightly different—less severe, more grounded, more human.
The change was intentional. Leto had suggested it quietly, not as a command but as an option. Artemis had accepted without argument. Diana fit this place better. The name slid over her like borrowed clothing that had been worn in before.
She adjusted the strap of her bag against her shoulder and kept walking.
What she noticed first was not the men.
It was the effort.
Her attention no longer snapped outward like a bowstring pulled too tight. Instead, it hovered, alert but restrained, as if she were holding something heavy just above the ground. Every step carried awareness with it—of posture, of proximity, of tone. She was present in her body in a way she wasn't used to being.
Tiring, she thought, without judgment.
A man brushed past her at the corner of the street, muttering an apology without looking back. Instinct flared—brief, sharp, automatic. Her shoulders tensed, breath catching for a fraction of a second.
Then she stopped it.
Not forcefully. Not angrily.
She let the tension loosen before it could settle, exhaled once, and kept walking.
The correction was small. Almost invisible.
It still cost her something.
By the time she reached the small square ahead, her jaw ached faintly, as if she'd been clenching it without noticing. She paused near the fountain, pretending to admire the stonework while she checked herself again. No danger. No insult. Just movement, coincidence, a crowded street.
Normal.
That word still felt strange in her mouth.
Leto lingered at the edge of the square, giving her space without retreating too far. Artemis caught the familiar shape of her in the corner of her vision and felt steadier for it, even as she resisted the impulse to lean on that presence too much.
This was the point, wasn't it?
To walk forward without armor.
To notice herself without immediately judging.
To exist in the space between reaction and response.
Artemis straightened, rolled her shoulders once, and stepped back into the flow of the city.
Diana, for now, would have to learn how to move here.
And learning, she was beginning to understand, was far more exhausting than certainty ever had been.
The café was small enough that the noise never rose above a murmur.
Metal chairs scraped softly against stone, cups clinked, a radio hummed somewhere behind the counter. Artemis chose a table near the edge, back to the wall without thinking—and then noticed she'd done it.
She didn't move.
The choice had already been made. Undoing it now would feel theatrical.
A man approached with a tray, navigating the narrow space between tables with practiced ease. He wore an apron dusted lightly with flour and moved like someone used to apologizing with his shoulders before his mouth caught up.
"Scusi," he said, sidestepping her chair.
Instinct sparked.
Her spine straightened, attention narrowing, senses sharpening in the old, familiar way. It was automatic, precise, efficient. A thousand past encounters had trained her to read movement first and intention second.
Then she stopped it.
Not the awareness—just the conclusion.
She let the tension ease a fraction, loosened her shoulders deliberately. The man was already past her, already turning toward another table, his focus elsewhere. No threat. No intrusion. Just proximity in a crowded place.
Her breath came out slow through her nose.
When he returned to take her order, she felt the effort more keenly. Her mind hovered just behind the moment, ready to intervene if she slipped. The man smiled out of habit rather than warmth, pen poised.
"What can I get you?" he asked, in careful English.
There it was again—that tightening, the reflexive appraisal. She caught it mid-formation this time, smoothed her expression before it reached her eyes.
"An espresso," she said. After a pause she added, "Please."
The word felt heavier than it should have.
He nodded, scribbled, moved on.
Artemis watched him cross the café, noticing details she usually filtered out: the way his shoulders slumped slightly when he reached the counter, the tired set of his mouth, the efficiency of hands that had done this too many times today. The world did not sharpen around him. It simply existed.
When he returned with her cup, he set it down carefully, fingers lingering just long enough to steady the saucer. "Here you go."
"Thank you," she replied, meeting his eyes briefly and then looking away—not as avoidance, but as choice.
He smiled again, a little more genuine this time, and moved off without another word.
Nothing had gone wrong.
That was the strange part.
She wrapped her hands around the cup, feeling the heat seep into her palms. The effort drained through her in a slow wave, leaving behind a faint ache behind her eyes. It had taken focus to remain where she was, to let the moment pass without armor or edge.
Neutral. Polite. Ordinary.
Artemis sipped her coffee and stared into the dark surface, aware of the cost even as she acknowledged the success.
She had checked herself.
It hadn't been hard.
It also hadn't been free.
The street market was louder than the café had been—voices overlapping, vendors calling out prices, footsteps pressing close in narrow lanes. Artemis moved through it with Leto a few steps behind, pretending not to notice how easily her stride adapted, how naturally she threaded through bodies without touching them.
She felt fine. Grounded. Balanced.
That was when a man reached for her arm.
Not roughly. Not forcefully. Just a brief, instinctive touch—two fingers brushing her sleeve as he leaned in to keep her from stepping backward into a passing cart.
"Careful—"
She twisted away before the word finished forming.
The reaction was sharp and immediate, her body already turning, eyes hardening, hand lifting half a breath from where a weapon would have been if this were another life. The man froze, palm raised in reflexive surrender, surprise written plainly across his face.
"I—sorry," he said quickly. "You almost—"
"Don't touch me," Artemis snapped.
The words landed heavier than she intended. The space around them thinned, nearby conversations stuttering as attention tilted their way.
She realized it a second too late.
The man's expression shifted—not anger, not offense, but something quieter. Embarrassment. A tightening around the eyes, a faint flush creeping up his neck. He nodded once, stiff and abrupt.
"Right," he said. "My mistake."
He stepped back into the crowd without another word, swallowed by movement and noise as if he'd never been there.
Artemis stood very still.
The market resumed its rhythm around her, but something had slipped out of alignment. The air felt heavier, her pulse loud in her ears. She replayed the moment unbidden—the touch, the warning, the look on his face when she cut him off.
Too fast. Too hard.
Leto appeared at her side, quiet, observant. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. The absence of comment pressed more than any reprimand could have.
"I didn't mean—" Artemis started, then stopped. The excuse formed easily, polished and ready, but she let it die unspoken.
Intent didn't erase impact.
She exhaled slowly, unclenching her jaw. The irritation that usually followed such encounters didn't come. No righteous anger. No sense of justified distance. Just a dull, uncomfortable awareness that she had misread the moment and acted on an old script.
It would have been easier if he'd argued. If he'd pushed back. If he'd deserved it.
But he hadn't.
As they moved on, Artemis felt the cost settle in—a thin, persistent discomfort, like a stone in her shoe. She had wanted to do better. She had almost done better.
Almost wasn't enough.
She didn't spiral. She didn't condemn herself. She simply carried the mistake with her, unlightened, unresolved.
And that, somehow, was worse.
The train south was late.
That much was clear from the way people stood rather than sat, from the glances cast at the departure board as if staring might shame it into changing. Artemis leaned against a pillar, bag at her feet, counting breaths without meaning to.
A man stood beside her—not close enough to crowd, not far enough to vanish. Middle-aged, neatly dressed, reading a folded newspaper with the concentration of someone killing time rather than consuming news.
She noticed him. She always noticed.
What she didn't do was decide anything about him.
The effort showed itself in small ways. She resisted cataloguing his movements, the angle of his elbows, the rhythm of his breathing. She let him be a shape in space rather than a possibility. It took more focus than she liked to admit.
After a few minutes, he sighed softly and folded the paper. "If this gets any later," he said to no one in particular, "we may arrive before we depart."
The comment hovered, unclaimed.
Artemis felt the familiar urge to retreat inward, to keep silence as a shield. Conversation invited variables. Variables led to assumptions. Assumptions led to friction.
She answered anyway.
"Trains," she said. "They do that."
He smiled, brief and genuine, and nodded as if she'd confirmed something he already believed. "You'd think after all this time they'd perfect it."
"Maybe delay is part of the design."
A pause followed. Not awkward. Just… present.
He didn't push. Didn't fill the space. Simply stood there, hands tucked into his coat pockets, eyes drifting back toward the board. The restraint surprised her. She realized she'd been bracing for the next line.
It never came.
When the announcement finally crackled overhead, he inclined his head toward her in mild triumph. "There we go."
They boarded in the same carriage but chose different seats without ceremony. No lingering. No expectation. Just two people sharing a moment that ended when it ended.
As the train pulled away, Artemis watched the countryside slide past the window—olive trees blurring into green streaks, stone walls dissolving into distance. Her reflection ghosted faintly in the glass, superimposed over the world beyond.
She waited for a reaction that didn't arrive.
No irritation. No pride. No relief sharp enough to be called victory. Just a quiet, persistent awareness of effort spent and effort saved. She hadn't defaulted. She hadn't overcorrected either.
It hadn't felt good.
It had felt… workable.
When Leto joined her a few minutes later, settling into the seat opposite, Artemis didn't immediately speak. She didn't need to explain the exchange; nothing remarkable had happened.
That, she realized, was the point.
As Italy receded behind them and the journey toward Greece began, Artemis closed her eyes briefly—not in escape, but in recalibration. The path forward wasn't smooth or clear.
But it was navigable.
And for now, that was enough.
The ferry smelled of salt and diesel and old paint baked warm by the sun.
Artemis stood at the rail while the shoreline pulled away, Italy shrinking into a suggestion of hills and stone and memory. The wind tugged at her hair, cool and persistent, carrying voices from the deck behind her—laughter, irritation, a child crying and being soothed.
She kept her eyes on the water.
Travel had always meant motion without attachment. Leave before roots form. Move before familiarity turns into expectation. It was a rule she had lived by for centuries, and it had never asked anything from her in return.
Now it did.
A man leaned on the rail several steps down, tossing breadcrumbs to the gulls with absentminded precision. He wasn't trying to draw attention, wasn't watching her reflection in the glassy metal. He existed alongside her, parallel rather than intersecting.
She felt the old itch to catalogue him—and didn't.
Instead, she focused on the rhythm of the waves slapping against the hull, the steady pulse of the engine beneath her feet. The world was large here, indifferent, ancient. It reminded her of herself in ways she didn't entirely like.
Leto joined her without comment, resting her forearms on the rail. For a long moment they watched the water together.
"You did better," Leto said at last, quietly.
Artemis stiffened, then relaxed. "I wasn't trying to."
"That's usually when it counts."
The words landed softly, without weight or demand. Artemis resisted the urge to argue—not because she agreed, but because she didn't want to turn the moment into a debate. The effort cost her more than the silence would have.
"I don't like this," she admitted after a while. "Not knowing which parts of me are… reflex. Which are choice."
Leto's gaze stayed on the horizon. "Most people never separate the two."
"I'm not most people."
"No," Leto agreed. "That's why it's harder."
A gull swooped low, snatching a crumb midair. The man down the rail laughed under his breath, pleased. Artemis watched him for a second too long, then looked away, irritated with herself for noticing at all.
She wasn't changing because she wanted to be liked. She wasn't changing because the world demanded it.
She was changing because staying the same had finally started to feel wrong.
The ferry horn sounded, long and low, announcing their approach. Greece waited ahead—white stone and sun-bleached roads, the weight of home and expectation layered thick in the air.
Artemis straightened, rolling her shoulders once as if shedding water.
Italy had been practice. A place to stumble without consequence.
Greece would not be so forgiving.
As the ferry cut through the last stretch of sea, Artemis stayed at the rail, eyes forward, bracing herself—not against men, not against the world, but against the effort she knew she would have to keep making.
And the quiet fear that one day, she might choose not to.
Greece did not feel like arrival.
It felt like pressure.
The port was bright and loud in a way Italy hadn't been—voices sharper, gestures broader, familiarity assumed rather than offered. Artemis felt it settle over her the moment her feet hit the dock, a weight she had carried before and resented every time.
Here, people recognized her shape, even if they did not know her name.
A dockhand waved them forward, calling instructions with easy authority. His tone wasn't rude. It was efficient. Used to being obeyed. Artemis felt her shoulders tighten anyway.
"Slow down," Leto murmured beside her, not a command, just a reminder.
Artemis exhaled through her nose and adjusted her pace. The man was already turning away, attention shifting to the next group. Nothing lingered. Nothing pressed.
Still, the irritation stayed.
They walked uphill toward the town, stone buildings stacked close together, balconies heavy with flowers. This was familiar ground—too familiar. Every interaction carried history, whether earned or imagined.
At a small bakery, Leto stopped to buy bread. Artemis waited outside, arms crossed, watching people pass. A pair of older men argued animatedly nearby, their voices rising and falling like a practiced dance. She tracked the volume, the posture, the proximity—then stopped herself.
You don't need to be on guard here, she told herself.
The lie tasted thin.
One of the men glanced her way, curiosity flickering across his face. Not appraisal. Not challenge. Just noticing something out of place. Artemis met his gaze for half a second longer than necessary before looking away, jaw tight.
When Leto returned, bread tucked under her arm, she studied Artemis's expression without comment.
"It's different here," Artemis said, before Leto could speak.
"Yes."
"They don't mean harm," Artemis added, sharper than she intended.
"No," Leto agreed again. "But meaning isn't the only thing that matters."
They continued walking. Artemis felt restless, skin too tight, patience fraying at the edges. Greece asked her to be herself in a way Italy hadn't. It remembered her. Expected her to fit.
At a crossroads, a young man stepped slightly into her path while gesturing to someone behind him. She adjusted automatically, sidestepping with clipped efficiency. He apologized quickly, sheepish, and moved on.
She realized she'd never looked at his face.
That bothered her.
Not because she'd avoided him—but because she hadn't chosen to.
As they climbed higher into the town, Artemis felt the effort return, heavier now, less forgiving. This was not a place to experiment. This was a place that would reflect her back at herself, unchanged.
She wasn't sure she was ready for that reflection.
But she kept walking anyway.
The afternoon heat settled in thick layers, pressing down on the town until even conversation seemed slower. Artemis sat on a low stone wall overlooking the narrow road below, watching shadows shorten and stretch as people passed.
This was where habits returned.
A group of young men walked together up the incline, laughing loudly, voices bouncing off stone. Nothing about them was threatening—sunburned skin, casual clothes, careless energy—but Artemis felt her attention narrow anyway. She tracked them without meaning to, gauging distance, predicting movement.
One of them glanced up and caught her looking.
The reflex fired before thought.
Her posture shifted, chin lifting just enough to signal warning, eyes sharpening into something colder. The message was old and well-practiced: Don't come closer. Don't try.
The young man slowed, confusion flickering across his face. He said something to his friends, laughter fading as they adjusted course, giving her a wider berth than necessary as they passed.
Artemis didn't relax when they were gone.
She stayed rigid, pulse ticking too fast, the echo of reaction ringing in her bones. The moment replayed itself, uninvited, highlighting the unnecessary escalation, the ease with which she'd slipped back into form.
She hadn't been touched. Hadn't been spoken to.
She'd acted anyway.
Leto joined her a few minutes later, settling beside her with deliberate calm. She didn't look at Artemis right away.
"That was familiar," Leto said.
Artemis huffed quietly. "I didn't mean to."
"I know."
The acceptance in the word irritated her more than disapproval would have.
"I saw it happening," Artemis said, frustration tightening her voice. "I knew what I was doing. And I still did it."
Leto turned then, studying her daughter's profile—not searching for fault, just listening. "Patterns don't disappear because we dislike them."
"I don't want this one anymore."
"That's not the same as knowing how to move without it."
Artemis clenched her hands, fingers digging into her palms. The effort she'd been making—catching herself, correcting—felt suddenly inadequate. It was easier in places where no one knew her, where nothing pressed old memories into motion.
Here, the world expected the huntress.
And she gave it exactly what it wanted.
"I don't want to be this," Artemis said quietly. Not angry. Not dramatic. Just tired.
Leto's hand rested briefly against her back, a grounding touch that didn't ask permission and didn't demand acceptance. Artemis didn't flinch—but she noticed that she'd allowed it.
"That's why we stay," Leto said. "Not because you're ready. Because you aren't."
The words settled, uncomfortable but steady.
Below them, the road filled again—vendors closing stalls, neighbors exchanging greetings, life resuming its ordinary rhythm. Artemis watched it all, aware of the distance she'd placed between herself and everyone else.
She hadn't failed.
But she hadn't succeeded either.
And for the first time, she couldn't tell which bothered her more.
The evening market unfolded in slow, deliberate layers—lanterns flickering on, voices lowering as the heat eased, the smell of grilled food drifting through the narrow streets. Artemis moved beside Leto, neither leading nor following, just matching pace.
She kept her hands visible.
It was a small thing. Deliberate. An anchor.
At a produce stall, a man argued cheerfully with the vendor over the price of figs. His gestures were broad, expressive, his laughter loud enough to turn a few heads. Artemis felt the familiar flicker of irritation spark, ready to harden into judgment.
She didn't feed it.
Instead, she shifted her weight and focused on the figs themselves—their deep purple skins, the sticky sweetness clinging to the air. The man paid, still smiling, and turned, nearly colliding with her.
"Oh—sorry," he said quickly, stepping back.
The moment hung there, fragile.
Her first instinct rose sharp and fast—distance, boundary, control. She felt it crest, ready to break into words or posture.
She chose something smaller.
"It's fine," Artemis said.
The words were plain. Unremarkable. They didn't carry warmth or warning—just acknowledgment.
The man nodded, relieved, and moved on without another glance.
Artemis stood very still, heart beating too fast for the insignificance of the exchange. The effort pulsed through her muscles, a quiet tremor she hid by reaching for a fig from the stall.
Her hand shook.
Leto paid without comment and guided them away, the basket warm between them. They walked in silence for a while, the market noise swelling and receding around them like tidewater.
"That took work," Leto said eventually.
Artemis didn't argue. "It shouldn't have."
"But it did."
The admission sat heavy in her chest. She hadn't done anything remarkable. She hadn't learned a lesson or gained clarity. She'd simply not reacted—and the restraint had cost her more than any confrontation would have.
Her mind replayed the moment, searching for error, for overcorrection. Had she sounded cold? Dismissive? Had she traded one distortion for another?
She didn't know.
That uncertainty itched.
As they climbed toward their lodging, Artemis felt the fatigue settle deeper, seeping into her bones. This wasn't fear. It wasn't anger either. It was the steady drain of vigilance turned inward.
At the doorway, she paused, fingers resting against the stone frame.
"I don't like how much this takes," she said, not looking at Leto.
Leto's response was immediate and gentle. "That doesn't mean it isn't worth doing."
Artemis closed her eyes for a brief second, then nodded once.
She hadn't grown softer.
She had simply taken a smaller step.
And somehow, that felt harder.
The morning began badly.
Not with conflict—worse. With nothing.
Artemis woke already tired, the kind of exhaustion that settled behind the eyes and refused to lift. The kind earned not by action, but by restraint. She dressed in silence, movements clipped, efficient, as if bracing for something she couldn't yet see.
Outside, the town was waking slowly. Shopkeepers raised shutters, neighbors exchanged greetings, the day arranging itself without concern for her internal calculus.
They walked downhill toward the square, and Artemis felt the familiar tension creep back—not sharp, not immediate, but constant. Like holding a bowstring half-drawn for hours.
A man stepped out of a doorway ahead of them, nearly colliding with her shoulder. He muttered an apology, distracted, already turning away.
She caught herself after the reaction started.
Her body angled away, expression tightening, breath pulling shallow. The old response didn't fully form—but it didn't vanish either. It lingered halfway, awkward and incomplete.
The man glanced back, misreading her stiffness as offense. "I said sorry," he added, a note of defensiveness creeping in.
There it was.
This was the moment she used to understand perfectly. The escalation point. The place where clarity lived.
Artemis hesitated.
The pause stretched just long enough to become uncomfortable.
"I know," she said finally. "I'm just—tired."
The admission surprised her as much as it did him.
His posture softened immediately, shoulders dropping as the tension evaporated. "Yeah," he said, almost rueful. "Me too."
They stood there for a second longer than necessary, then he nodded and moved on.
Artemis felt the exchange settle into her chest—not clean, not victorious. The moment hadn't gone wrong, but it hadn't gone smoothly either. It carried friction, the residue of a near-miss.
She hated that.
The old way would have been sharper. Faster. Clean.
This way was messy.
As they continued walking, Artemis felt the weight of it press in—not fear, not doubt, but frustration. She had chosen differently. She had tried.
And it had still cost her.
Leto glanced at her, reading the tension without comment. She didn't intervene. Didn't soothe. Artemis was left alone with the outcome of her choice.
"I did what you said," Artemis muttered at last.
Leto stopped walking.
"I never said it would feel better," she replied calmly. "Only that it would be yours."
The distinction landed hard.
Artemis resumed walking, jaw tight, mind churning. Understanding wasn't clarity. It wasn't peace. It was work—ongoing, imperfect, exhausting work that didn't even promise immediate reward.
She wasn't afraid anymore.
She was irritated.
And somehow, that felt like progress she hadn't asked for—but couldn't ignore.
They stopped for lunch near the edge of the square, a place that looked forgettable enough to be safe. Wooden tables, uneven legs, the smell of oil and bread. Artemis chose a seat in the shade and set her bag at her feet, deliberately not scanning the room.
She was tired of scanning.
A server approached—a young man, not much older than she was now in this body. He smiled automatically, pen ready, eyes moving between them.
"What can I get you?" he asked.
Artemis felt the familiar tightening start—then stopped it. She softened her shoulders, kept her gaze neutral, waited an extra beat before speaking.
"I'll have the grilled vegetables," she said.
He nodded, scribbled, turned to Leto.
When he left, Artemis noticed her fingers tapping lightly against the table. She stilled them with effort.
The food arrived quickly. The plate was wrong.
Not disastrously. Just… not what she'd ordered. Meat instead of vegetables, the smell heavy and unmistakable.
Her first instinct surged—sharp, indignant, ready. This was an error. It needed correcting. Immediately.
She checked herself.
Don't snap. Don't assume. Don't turn it into a thing.
She raised her hand when the server passed again. He stopped, attentive but wary now, something in her posture already signaling complication.
"Excuse me," she said, keeping her tone even. "I ordered the vegetables."
He frowned, glancing at the plate. "You did?"
"Yes."
He hesitated, uncertainty flickering. "I wrote this down," he said, tapping his notepad. Not accusing. Just… defensive.
Artemis felt irritation spike—then push it down harder than before. Too hard.
"Oh," she said. "Then it's fine. Don't worry about it."
The words came out too quickly.
Relief washed over his face. "Alright," he said, already turning away. "If you need anything—"
He was gone before she could stop herself.
The plate sat there between her and Leto, cooling.
Leto looked at it, then at Artemis. Said nothing.
Artemis stared at the food, jaw tight. She'd meant to choose restraint—not erasure. She hadn't wanted to cause trouble, hadn't wanted to default into sharpness.
But she hadn't wanted this either.
"I should've said something," Artemis muttered.
"Yes," Leto agreed quietly.
The simple confirmation stung.
Artemis pushed the plate away slightly, appetite gone. The loss was small—lunch, comfort, correctness. Nothing meaningful.
And yet it scraped.
This was the cost she hadn't anticipated: not just effort, but miscalibration. Pulling back so far she disappeared. Avoiding conflict by swallowing herself instead.
She hadn't defaulted.
She'd overcorrected.
As they left the table behind, Artemis felt the frustration settle deep, heavy and unresolved. Understanding, she realized, wasn't just knowing when not to react.
It was learning when to speak—and she wasn't there yet.
They walked for a long time after lunch, the road winding upward into quieter streets where tourists thinned and locals reclaimed the day. Artemis felt the mistake from the café sit heavy in her chest—not as guilt, but as irritation sharpened by hunger.
Not at the food.
At herself.
She replayed the moment again and again, seeing where she'd veered too far, where restraint had tipped into disappearance. The effort wasn't in noticing anymore. It was in deciding how much of herself was allowed to exist in a moment.
At a small roadside stand, Leto stopped to buy water. Artemis lingered a few steps back, watching dust drift lazily in the heat. The vendor—an older man with weathered hands—passed a bottle to Leto, then glanced at Artemis.
"You want one too?" he asked, tone casual, inclusive.
The reflex stirred. Not sharp this time—just wary. Artemis felt the familiar urge to defer, to let Leto answer, to avoid even this small engagement.
She didn't.
"Yes," she said, stepping forward. "Please."
The man nodded and reached for another bottle. When he handed it to her, their fingers brushed briefly.
Her body reacted—and she caught it in time.
She didn't flinch. Didn't pull back. Didn't harden.
She took the bottle.
"Thank you," she said, and meant it.
The exchange was ordinary. Unremarkable. It ended exactly where it should have.
As they moved on, Artemis noticed her breathing had steadied faster than it had earlier. The effort was still there, but it hadn't spiked into discomfort or collapse. She hadn't erased herself to maintain peace.
That mattered.
"I didn't disappear that time," she said, almost to herself.
Leto glanced sideways. "No."
"I didn't feel… punished for speaking either."
"That's usually how it works," Leto replied. "Most of the time."
Artemis frowned slightly. "I don't like that it's a calculation."
Leto smiled faintly. "Neither do most people. They just do it anyway."
They climbed higher, the town spreading below them in white and gold. Artemis paused near a low wall, twisting the bottle cap open and taking a long drink. The water was lukewarm, grounding.
She wasn't fixed.
She wasn't even confident.
But she had adjusted—not in theory, not in hindsight, but in motion.
The realization didn't bring relief. It brought something closer to determination.
Understanding wasn't about replacing one rule with another. It was about finding the line—and being willing to redraw it every time it shifted.
That sounded exhausting.
Artemis straightened, rolling her shoulders once.
She kept walking anyway.
They left Greece at dawn.
The sky was pale, washed thin of color, the kind of morning that felt unfinished. Artemis stood on the deck as the ferry eased away from the harbor, the town retreating into white shapes and memory. She felt lighter than she had days ago—and heavier for knowing why.
This wasn't relief.
It was accumulation.
Every moment of restraint, every correction mid-thought, every misstep carried forward with her. She hadn't shed anything in Greece. She'd learned how much she was willing to carry without dropping herself entirely.
A man leaned against the opposite rail, headphones on, eyes closed, face turned toward the breeze. Artemis noticed him—and then noticed how she noticed him. Not as a potential problem. Not as something to brace against.
Just as a presence.
The realization came quietly, without triumph. She didn't hold onto it. She let it pass like everything else.
Italy had taught her to pause.
Greece had taught her to endure the pause without becoming smaller.
As the ferry cut through open water, Artemis felt the effort settle into a steadier rhythm. Still tiring. Still deliberate. But no longer sharp at the edges. The ache behind her eyes dulled into something manageable.
She hadn't found peace.
She had found practice.
Leto joined her at the rail, hands folded loosely, gaze fixed on the horizon. They didn't speak. They didn't need to. The silence between them was not empty—it was full of unfinished work and shared understanding.
"Next," Artemis said eventually, not a question.
"Yes," Leto replied.
Italy had been trial.
Greece had been resistance.
What came next would ask something different of her. Artemis felt it in the set of her spine, in the quiet readiness beneath the fatigue. She was not bracing anymore.
She was preparing.
As the sun climbed higher and the water brightened, Artemis turned her face into the wind. She wasn't looking for certainty. She wasn't seeking forgiveness—from herself or anyone else.
She was learning how to move forward without the old tools.
And though the effort still weighed on her, she no longer wondered whether it was worth making.
She stepped back from the rail as the ferry surged onward, carrying her away from home—not in escape, but in continuation.
The work wasn't finished.
But it had begun to move with her, instead of against her.
America announced itself loudly.
The airport was all glass and steel and motion, a constant churn of people moving with purpose or pretending to. Artemis felt the shift immediately—the pace faster, the distances wider, the assumptions different. No shared history pressed in here. No memory clung to her skin.
That should have made it easier.
It didn't.
She walked beside Leto through the terminal, senses alert in a way that felt reflexive rather than chosen. Here, the crowd didn't look at her the same way. Curiosity skimmed instead of lingering. Boundaries were implied rather than negotiated.
She didn't know which version of herself this place expected.
Outside, the air was dry and bright, the sun harsher than Greece's warmth. Cars streamed past in steady lines, engines humming like insects. Artemis paused for a half-second too long at the curb, recalibrating.
A man behind her cleared his throat—not impatient, just present.
She felt the reaction start, caught it early, let it soften. Stepped forward.
They found a small place to stay not far from the river—clean, anonymous, forgettable in the best way. Artemis set her bag down and stood still for a moment, listening to unfamiliar sounds through the open window: traffic, voices drifting upward, music leaking from a passing car.
This place did not know her.
The thought should have comforted her.
Instead, it unsettled her.
Later, they walked along the river path, the water wide and steady, reflecting the sky in broken fragments. People passed in pairs and groups, runners threading between them, cyclists ringing bells in warning. Artemis tracked the movement without sinking into it, effort humming quietly beneath the surface.
A man jogged past too close, shoulder nearly brushing hers. She adjusted her step without snapping, without vanishing. The correction was clean.
That surprised her.
She slowed, letting Leto move a step ahead.
"This feels… different," Artemis said.
"It is," Leto replied. "Different rules. Different expectations."
"I don't know what I'm supposed to be here."
Leto didn't answer immediately. "Then don't decide yet."
Artemis frowned. "That's never been an option."
"It is now."
They stopped near the rail, watching the river slide past with unhurried confidence. Artemis rested her hands against the cool metal, grounding herself. She felt the effort still there—present, persistent—but it wasn't fighting her anymore.
She wasn't defaulting.
She wasn't overcorrecting either.
She was… holding.
As dusk settled, the lights along the river flickered on, one by one. Artemis watched the reflections ripple, break, reform. Understanding didn't arrive in a neat shape. It didn't resolve anything.
But for the first time, standing in a place that owed her nothing and expected even less, Artemis felt the possibility of movement without armor.
She stayed at the rail a while longer, not waiting for certainty—just letting the moment exist.
Tomorrow would ask more of her.
For now, this was enough.
The diner smelled like grease and coffee and something sweet trying too hard to be comforting.
Artemis slid into the booth opposite Leto, vinyl sticking faintly to her skin. The place was half-full—late afternoon, between rushes. People talked in low clusters, forks scraping plates, a bell chiming softly every time the kitchen door swung open.
This was supposed to be easy.
Anonymous places usually were.
A server approached—male, mid-thirties, tired eyes, practiced smile. He placed menus down with quick efficiency. "I'll be right back with water."
Artemis nodded, already bracing for the interaction she told herself she didn't need to brace for.
When he returned, he leaned in slightly to set the glasses down, one hand steadying the table as it wobbled. His arm crossed her field of view for half a second longer than necessary.
Her chest tightened.
Too close.
The judgment formed fast, slick and familiar. Her mind filled in intention where there was only proximity. She felt the old reaction press forward, ready to shape her voice, her posture.
She stopped it.
Not smoothly—hesitantly.
The pause stretched just long enough to be noticed.
"Everything okay?" the server asked, brow creasing.
"Yes," Artemis said, a beat too late. "Sorry."
The word came out wrong. Not defensive—uncertain.
He straightened immediately, hands lifting in an unconscious gesture of retreat. "Didn't mean to crowd you," he said. "Old tables."
He moved away quickly, expression neutral but guarded now.
Artemis sat frozen.
That hadn't been a success.
She'd caught herself—but not in time to prevent damage. The misread had already colored the moment, already shifted the dynamic. She felt it settle like grit between her teeth.
"I assumed," Artemis said quietly, more to herself than to Leto.
"Yes," Leto replied.
"I didn't snap."
"No."
"But I still—" Artemis trailed off, frustrated. She pressed her fingers together under the table, grounding herself in the small pressure. "I still treated him like a problem."
Leto didn't contradict her.
The server returned later to take their order, polite but distant. Efficient. Careful. Artemis felt the cost then—not sharp, not dramatic, just present. A small fracture where there hadn't needed to be one.
She ordered simply and kept her tone neutral, correcting nothing, explaining nothing. It wasn't her job to fix every misstep. She knew that.
But knowing didn't make the weight disappear.
When the food arrived, the plate was right this time. Artemis ate slowly, appetite dulled by the lingering awareness of her mistake. She hadn't defaulted into aggression.
She'd defaulted into assumption.
As they paid and stood to leave, the server nodded at them, professional and contained. Artemis returned the nod, feeling the unfinished nature of the exchange press against her ribs.
Outside, the air felt cooler, wider.
"That one cost you," Leto said gently.
Artemis nodded. "Not much."
"No," Leto agreed. "But enough to feel."
Artemis looked back once at the diner window, then turned away.
Understanding, she realized, wasn't about getting it right.
It was about noticing why she got it wrong—and carrying that forward without armor or apology.
They walked afterward without deciding where to go, letting the streets choose for them. The city thinned as they moved away from the river—brick buildings giving way to quieter blocks, trees breaking the lines of concrete.
Artemis felt the diner incident follow her like a low-grade ache. Not shame. Not anger. Something closer to irritation with herself for having misjudged—and then for not knowing how to correct without making it worse.
The work didn't end when the moment did. That was the part she resented most.
At a small bookstore tucked between a laundromat and a florist, Leto slowed and went inside. Artemis hesitated, then followed, the bell over the door chiming softly.
The place smelled of paper and dust and lemon cleaner. Narrow aisles forced proximity. Artemis noted it and adjusted—not by stiffening, but by choosing where to stand. She kept her space without claiming more than she needed.
A man browsing nearby reached for a book on the same shelf she was scanning. Their hands brushed.
This time, the reaction came—and passed.
She felt it rise, recognized it instantly, and let it dissolve without ceremony. No pause. No explanation. No tightening in her voice.
"Sorry," he said automatically.
"It's fine," Artemis replied, and kept reading.
That was it.
No echo. No cost she could feel afterward. The ease of it surprised her more than the success itself.
She closed the book she'd been pretending to examine and stepped aside, making room without retreating. The man took the book, nodded once, and moved on.
Artemis stood there, oddly steady.
This hadn't been a breakthrough. No insight had clicked into place. She hadn't suddenly understood anything new about men or the world.
She had simply adjusted—mid-motion, without drama.
When Leto found her a few minutes later, Artemis didn't look up right away. "That one didn't hurt," she said.
Leto's mouth curved faintly. "Because you didn't make it into a test."
Artemis considered that. "I didn't try to be right. Or careful."
"You were present," Leto said. "That's usually enough."
They left the bookstore together, the bell chiming again as the door closed behind them. Outside, the afternoon light had softened, shadows stretching long and forgiving across the pavement.
Artemis felt tired—but not scraped raw the way she had earlier. The effort was still there, but it moved with her now, not against her stride.
She hadn't gained approval. No one had noticed what she'd done differently.
And for the first time, that didn't feel like a loss.
It felt… correct.
She walked on, carrying the adjustment forward—not as a rule, not as a promise, but as something she could do again if she needed to.
That was enough.
The afternoon thinned into evening without announcement.
They found themselves back near the river as the sky began to dull, light flattening into softer tones. Artemis leaned on the rail, elbows resting against cool metal, watching the water carry reflections that never stayed whole for long.
This was usually where she grew restless.
Too still. Too much time to think.
A man stood a short distance away, sketchbook balanced against his knee, pencil moving in small, decisive strokes. He wasn't watching her. He wasn't watching anyone. His attention stayed on the page, expression set in quiet focus.
Artemis noticed—and didn't interpret.
She watched the way his hand moved, the economy of it, the certainty. It reminded her of archery practice long ago, when the body learned what to do before the mind interfered. The comparison came uninvited, then faded.
He shifted slightly, glanced up, and caught her looking.
The moment hung.
She didn't flinch. Didn't harden. Didn't soften either.
He nodded once, polite and neutral, then returned to his sketch.
Artemis felt something ease in her chest—not relief, not approval. Just the absence of strain. The interaction ended exactly where it should have.
After a few minutes, he packed up his things and walked past her, close enough to register but not close enough to intrude. As he passed, he spoke without slowing.
"Good light tonight," he said, more observation than invitation.
"Yes," Artemis replied.
That was all.
He didn't turn back. Didn't linger. The exchange dissolved into the evening as cleanly as it had formed.
Artemis stayed at the rail, aware of how unremarkable the moment had been—and how much that mattered. She hadn't measured herself. Hadn't checked her reactions after the fact. The effort had been present, but light, like a muscle finally learning its range.
Leto joined her, gaze following the path the man had taken before returning to the water. "That was different," she said.
Artemis nodded. "I didn't think about it."
"Exactly."
The city lights flickered on, one by one, reflections stretching across the river's surface. Artemis watched them without urgency. Understanding didn't arrive as a revelation. It came as competence—quiet, repeatable, unspectacular.
She wasn't fixed.
But she was functioning.
And for the first time, the idea didn't irritate her.
She pushed away from the rail and straightened, the movement unguarded. Tomorrow would bring new moments, new chances to misread or misstep.
She didn't dread them.
She simply acknowledged they would come—and that she could meet them without armor, without erasure, without making every interaction a trial.
That felt like progress she could live with.
The evening air cooled just enough to make walking comfortable.
They found a small food truck tucked into a corner lot, strings of lights buzzing faintly overhead. People stood in loose clusters, waiting, talking in half-finished sentences. Artemis took her place in line beside Leto, hands relaxed at her sides.
A man ahead of them turned slightly, checking the menu posted above the truck. "You been here before?" he asked, tone easy, not angled.
The question landed without friction.
Artemis felt the reflex stir—then settle. No tightening. No spike. Just awareness.
"No," she answered. "But it smells good."
He smiled, quick and unassuming. "It usually is. Takes a while, though."
"That's fine," she said. And meant it.
The line crept forward. The man commented once more about the wait, about how the city never seemed to agree on how hungry it was at night. Artemis responded when it felt natural, let silence exist when it didn't. She didn't track his hands. Didn't weigh his proximity. She simply stood there, present.
Nothing pressed. Nothing demanded.
When they reached the counter, he ordered and stepped aside, giving her space without being asked. She ordered next, voice steady, unguarded.
As they waited, he nodded toward the river lights in the distance. "Looks different at night," he said.
"Yes," Artemis replied. "Calmer."
He considered that, then shrugged. "Depends on where you're standing."
She almost smiled.
The food came. He thanked the server, wished them both a good night, and walked off without expectation. The exchange ended cleanly—no residue, no cost.
Artemis realized she wasn't replaying it.
They sat at a nearby table, eating in companionable quiet. The food was good—simple, satisfying. Artemis noticed the taste instead of the room.
"That one didn't take anything out of you," Leto observed.
Artemis paused, checking in with herself. The fatigue was still there, low and constant, but it hadn't spiked. She wasn't hollowed out by effort.
"No," she said slowly. "It didn't."
"Why?"
Artemis thought about it. "I didn't try to manage it. Or myself."
Leto nodded, satisfied.
Artemis finished her meal, wiped her hands, and leaned back in the chair. The night moved around them—voices, laughter, footsteps—without demanding her attention.
This wasn't understanding as theory. It wasn't a lesson she could recite.
It was something quieter: the knowledge that she could have a normal conversation, let it exist, and walk away without feeling diminished or armored.
She stood when they were done, posture easy.
For once, she didn't feel like she'd won or lost anything.
She'd just… been there.
And that felt like something she could build on.
The river path curved ahead, widening where the bank dipped low and the water slowed. Night settled in layers—cooler air, softer edges, sound carrying farther than it should. Artemis walked a few steps ahead of Leto, not out of impatience, just momentum.
She was tired.
Not scraped, not raw—used. The good kind of tired, earned by choosing again and again.
A group of people gathered near the railing farther on, laughter lifting and falling. Artemis adjusted her path to pass wide, unthinking. The adjustment came easily now, like a foot finding ground it had already learned.
Then she saw him.
He stood apart from the group, half-turned toward the water, attention fixed on something downstream. There was nothing remarkable about him at first glance—dark hair, unassuming clothes, posture relaxed without being careless. What caught her wasn't his shape.
It was the stillness.
Not absence. Presence without noise.
Artemis slowed without realizing she had. Her breath caught—not in alarm, not in anticipation. Just… recognition of a moment that refused to be background.
He shifted, glanced over his shoulder, and met her eyes.
The world narrowed—not sharpened. Softened.
She felt the reflex rise and found nothing to anchor to. No threat assessment. No need to brace or retreat. The effort she'd been carrying didn't spike; it went quiet, as if waiting.
They held the look for a heartbeat too long.
Then he smiled—not wide, not practiced. A small, uncertain curve, like someone acknowledging a coincidence they didn't fully understand.
Artemis returned it before thinking.
The realization landed after: she hadn't checked herself. Hadn't moderated or measured. The reaction had simply happened—and hadn't cost her anything.
He stepped closer to the rail, giving her space without ceremony. "It's calmer over there," he said, nodding downstream. Not an invitation. Just information.
"Yes," she replied. The word felt sufficient.
They stood like that for a moment—parallel, not intersecting—watching the water carry light and shadow together. She noticed the way his attention stayed outward, not on her. Not probing. Not seeking.
It felt… safe, in a way she hadn't defined before.
Leto paused a few steps back, watching without interrupting.
After a beat, he nodded once, polite and oddly formal, and turned back toward the group. The moment ended as cleanly as it had begun.
Artemis exhaled, slow and steady.
She didn't chase it. Didn't analyze it. She let it remain what it was: brief, unclaimed, unresolved.
As she walked on, the feeling followed—not hunger, not fear. Something quieter and heavier. A moment that stayed without asking permission.
Understanding, she realized, wasn't always effort.
Sometimes it arrived as silence that didn't need defending.
And she carried that with her into the night, unsure why it mattered—only certain that it did.
The moment did not follow her the way she expected.
Artemis waited for it to bloom into something—curiosity sharpening into pursuit, memory looping back with insistence, the old patterns demanding meaning be assigned. None of that happened.
Instead, the feeling settled.
It stayed where it had landed, like a stone dropped into water after the ripples had already passed.
She walked with Leto through the quieter streets, the city thinning into pockets of light and shadow. Her body felt normal again—no heightened awareness, no dull ache of restraint. Just motion. Just breath.
That unsettled her more than the encounter itself.
She kept checking for the effort she had grown used to carrying, half-expecting it to surge back in response to the memory. It didn't. The silence around the moment remained intact, undisturbed by doubt or analysis.
"I didn't do anything," Artemis said eventually.
Leto glanced at her. "You did plenty."
"I didn't stop myself. I didn't correct anything. I didn't—" She searched for the word. "Work."
"No," Leto agreed. "You didn't."
Artemis frowned, not in irritation, but in confusion. "That's not how it's been."
"No," Leto said again. "But it doesn't mean it was wrong."
They reached their lodging and climbed the stairs in quiet steps. Artemis paused at the window afterward, looking out over the street below. A couple passed, arguing softly. Somewhere farther away, someone laughed. Life continued with careless confidence.
She touched the glass lightly, grounding herself.
The encounter replayed once—not as a loop, not as an intrusion. Just a single, complete memory. His stillness. The absence of pressure. The way her body hadn't prepared for anything at all.
It hadn't asked her to choose.
That was new.
She waited for the discomfort to arrive—for the sense of vulnerability, for the warning bells that usually followed unguarded moments. None came. What remained wasn't peace, exactly.
It was space.
Artemis sat on the edge of the bed, elbows on her knees, and stared at the floor. Understanding wasn't a declaration. It wasn't a rule she could enforce.
It was the recognition that not every interaction required vigilance—and that noticing this didn't mean abandoning herself.
She didn't know what the moment meant.
She didn't need to.
When she lay down later, sleep came easier than it had in days. The city hummed beyond the walls, distant and unconcerned.
The stone remained where it had landed.
And for the first time, Artemis didn't feel the need to pick it up.
Morning arrived without urgency.
Light filtered through the curtains in thin bands, warming the floor before it reached the bed. Artemis woke slowly, not startled, not already braced. The city outside was beginning its daily rearrangement—cars starting, voices rising, doors opening and closing.
The moment from the night before was there when she surfaced.
It didn't rush her.
She noticed that first.
She lay still for a while, cataloguing the absence of familiar reactions. No spike of anticipation. No compulsion to revisit the place by the river. No pull to search the crowd for a shape she barely remembered.
That, somehow, felt intentional—even though she hadn't decided it.
When she joined Leto for breakfast downstairs, the space was busy but unremarkable. Artemis moved through it with the quiet competence she'd been practicing, ordering coffee, taking a seat by the window. She felt steady. Awake.
"You're not restless," Leto observed.
Artemis considered the statement. "I thought I would be."
"And?"
"I'm not."
The truth surprised her again. She'd spent centuries learning how to track, how to follow threads until they revealed themselves. The urge to pursue—to know—was ingrained.
This time, she let the thread lie.
They went out afterward, walking the same streets as the day before. Artemis found herself glancing toward the river once, then deliberately looking away—not as denial, but as choice. The moment didn't vanish when she did. It stayed intact, unthreatened by distance.
A man passed close behind her on the sidewalk. She adjusted her step without thinking, body flowing around the movement. No tension followed. No need to check.
That mattered more than she expected.
"I could go back," Artemis said suddenly. Not as a suggestion. Just a statement.
"Yes," Leto replied.
"But I don't need to."
Leto smiled—not approving, not relieved. Simply present. "That's the difference."
They crossed an intersection and paused at the corner, waiting for the signal to change. Artemis watched the crowd surge and settle, people moving with their own internal logic. She didn't feel separate from them. She didn't feel absorbed either.
She felt placed.
The light changed. They crossed.
Artemis didn't look back.
Understanding, she realized, wasn't found in pursuit. It was in the ability to let something meaningful exist without demanding it turn into more.
That didn't make the moment smaller.
It made her larger.
And as the city carried on around her, Artemis walked forward—unhurried, unburdened—choosing not to chase, and finding that nothing was lost in the choosing.
The afternoon tested her in quieter ways.
They stopped at a small community center near the river—open doors, a bulletin board cluttered with flyers, the low hum of voices drifting from inside. Leto wanted to ask about a local exhibit; Artemis followed, expecting nothing more than a few minutes of polite waiting.
Inside, the air was cooler. A woman at the desk looked up, smiled, and gestured for them to come closer. Artemis stepped forward without thinking—and then halted, realizing she'd moved too fast, too decisively, crowding the space.
She corrected, taking a half-step back.
The woman didn't seem to notice the adjustment. She explained the exhibit dates, her voice practiced, friendly. Artemis listened, nodding at the right moments, keeping her posture open without leaning in or pulling away.
It took effort again.
Not the sharp, draining kind—but a steady application, like holding a line against current.
When the explanation ended, Artemis asked a question. Not a safe one. Not a neutral one. One that showed interest.
The woman brightened, launching into details, gesturing toward a hallway where framed photographs lined the walls. Artemis followed, then slowed, letting the woman lead instead. She felt the calculation hum and resisted the urge to simplify it by retreating.
Halfway down the hall, a man stepped out of a side room carrying a stack of folders. He startled when he saw them, nearly dropping everything.
Artemis reacted—too quickly.
She reached out to steady the folders, hand brushing his wrist. The contact was brief, functional—but she felt the flicker of awareness spark after the fact.
The man recovered, smiling in thanks. "Appreciate it," he said.
Artemis nodded. "Of course."
The woman glanced between them, then continued talking, unfazed. The moment passed without consequence.
Still, Artemis felt the aftershock—not fear, not irritation. Attention. She replayed it once, assessing.
She hadn't defaulted into defense.
She hadn't erased herself.
She'd acted—and then stopped.
That was new too.
Outside again, the light had shifted, clouds moving in thin layers overhead. Artemis breathed in, slow and deliberate, letting the effort settle instead of resisting it.
"That took work," she said.
"Yes," Leto agreed.
"But it didn't undo anything."
"No."
Artemis walked on, muscles loosening incrementally. Understanding wasn't something she reached and kept. It was something she reapplied, again and again, adjusting to context, to fatigue, to the shape of the moment.
She didn't resent that anymore.
Effort didn't mean failure.
It meant engagement.
And as the river reappeared ahead, Artemis felt grounded—not because the work was finished, but because she knew how to continue it without losing herself along the way.
The last evening came quietly.
No marker announced it, no sense of completion or ceremony. The city simply dimmed into itself as the sun slid low, light flattening against buildings and glass until everything looked briefly unreal.
Artemis stood at the river one final time.
She didn't search the crowd.
That choice felt settled now—not effortful, not performative. The place where she'd stood before looked no different than any other stretch of railing. People leaned, talked, passed through. The water kept moving, indifferent and patient.
She rested her forearms against the rail and let herself be there.
The work of the past days surfaced—not as memories, but as weight distribution. How she stood. How she breathed. Where her attention settled and where it didn't. Nothing was sharp anymore. Nothing needed correction in advance.
A man passed behind her, close enough to register. She shifted a fraction to make space, fluid and unremarkable. The movement didn't linger in her mind after.
That was the clearest sign of change.
Leto joined her, shoulder brushing hers lightly. Artemis didn't tense. She leaned into the contact without thinking, grounding herself in the familiarity of it.
"I don't feel finished," Artemis said.
Leto smiled faintly. "Good."
Artemis exhaled, a quiet huff of agreement. "I used to think understanding meant resolution."
"And now?"
"Now it feels like… maintenance." She considered the word. "Choice. Over and over."
"Yes."
They stood together, watching the river carry light and shadow toward places Artemis would never see. She thought of Italy—the pause. Greece—the resistance. America—the adjustment, the mistake, the ease she hadn't expected.
And the moment that had stayed without asking to be more.
She didn't romanticize it. Didn't elevate it into meaning it couldn't hold. It remained what it was: a point of reference, not a destination.
That felt right.
As they turned away from the river, Artemis glanced once more at the water—not in longing, not in reluctance. Just acknowledgment.
She would return to Greece changed—but not transformed. She would still misstep. Still tire. Still default sometimes when she was careless or exhausted.
But now she knew the difference between resistance and choice.
She knew she could engage without losing herself.
And as she walked back through the city, posture easy, stride unguarded, Artemis carried that knowledge with her—not as a promise, not as a victory.
Just as something earned.
Something human.
Something she intended to keep.

________________________________________
Texas, US
Texas did not announce itself the way places usually did to Artemis. It didn't challenge her, didn't glare, didn't dare her to react. It simply existed—hot, loud, sprawling—and she stepped into it with the faint, unsettling realization that nothing in her pushed back.
She adjusted the strap of her bag and moved with the flow of people exiting the terminal. Men passed close enough to brush shoulders. Voices overlapped. Someone laughed too loudly near the curb. Her body waited for the familiar tightening—for the coil of instinct that used to arrive before thought—but it never did. The absence was… quiet. Not relief. Just space.
Leto followed half a step behind, the way she always did when Artemis was not meant to lead. Not command. Not correct. This visit had boundaries, and Artemis was keenly aware of them. She was banned. Officially. No authority over the Hunters. No orders. No restructuring. She was here for a check—health, morale, stability—and then she was supposed to leave.
She repeated that to herself as they crossed into the parking structure.
"I'm not here to run anything," Artemis said, tone even. "Just to see them."
Leto's mouth curved, barely. "You say that as if saying it enough times will make it boring."
"It should be boring," Artemis replied. "Routine is good."
"And yet," Leto said lightly, "you chose Texas."
Artemis didn't answer right away. Heat shimmered across the concrete. Cars idled. A man argued into his phone about directions. Ordinary things. She found that she didn't resent them.
"The Hunters are here," she said finally. "And if I can't protect them the way I used to, I can at least make sure they're standing."
Leto hummed in acknowledgment, neither approving nor discouraging. That was new, too. Once, Leto would have corrected her phrasing. Once, Artemis would have bristled at the implication.
They reached the car. Artemis slid into the passenger seat, checked her phone, and saw the message waiting—coordinates, a short status update, sent by one of the younger Hunters. Efficient. Precise. Tech-savvy. The kind Artemis would have dismissed years ago as unfocused.
She stared at the screen a second longer than necessary.
"Still there?" Leto asked, starting the engine.
"Yes," Artemis said, locking the phone. "They're expecting a check-in. Nothing more."
"And that's all you intend to give them?"
Artemis looked out at the city as they pulled onto the road. The skyline rose in uneven lines, glass and steel catching the sun. She felt tall in her body again—not imposing, not diminished. Just present.
"That's all I'm allowed," she said.
Leto's smile flickered, unreadable. "For now."
Artemis didn't respond. The car merged into traffic, Texas unfolding ahead of them—wide, indifferent, and unaware that she was passing through under rules she had never needed before.
Texas unfolded in layers the longer they drove—wide roads feeding into narrower ones, glass giving way to brick, heat softening the edges of everything. Artemis watched it pass without cataloguing angles or exits. The habit surfaced once, then slipped away when she didn't reach for it.
They stopped at a café near a strip of offices and repair shops, the kind of place that smelled like burnt coffee and sugar and stayed open because people needed it to be. Artemis ordered without thinking. The barista smiled, handed over the cup, moved on. No ceremony. No scrutiny. The exchange ended where it began.
She stood near the window, letting the cup warm her palms. Outside, a group of men argued cheerfully over a parking spot. One gestured too broadly, laughed at himself, conceded. It was all terribly… normal.
"You're staring," Leto said, dry as dust.
"I'm observing," Artemis replied.
"Same thing," Leto said. "Different excuses."
Artemis took a sip. The coffee was bad. She didn't mind. "I'm recalibrating."
"That sounds suspiciously like thinking."
Artemis glanced at her. "I do think."
"Not like this," Leto said. "This is the kind where you don't look ready to throw something."
"That's progress," Artemis said, and surprised herself by meaning it.
They left the café and walked a block, the sun pressing down with a lazy insistence. A man brushed past Artemis and muttered an apology without stopping. She nodded without irritation. The moment ended. Her body didn't store it. That, too, was new.
Leto slowed, matching her pace. "You know," she said lightly, "once upon a time, you would've taken that as a personal failing of the universe."
"Once upon a time, the universe encouraged it," Artemis said.
"And now?"
Artemis considered. "Now it's… inefficient."
Leto's eyebrow lifted. "That's the word you're going with?"
"It's accurate."
They reached the car again. Artemis checked her phone. Another message from the same Hunter—short update, nothing urgent. All accounted for. Waiting.
Waiting. The word sat strangely in her chest. Not as pressure. As expectation.
"I'm not staying," Artemis said, more firmly than necessary. "I'm not stepping in."
"Mm," Leto said. "You've said that."
"I mean it."
"I know," Leto replied. "That's why I'm curious."
Artemis frowned. "About what?"
"How long you'll be satisfied just watching."
The question landed without sting. Artemis leaned back against the car, eyes lifting to the sky—too big, too blue, unconcerned with her rules. "Long enough," she said. "To make sure they're alive. Stable. That's it."
Leto smiled, small and knowing. "For someone with no authority, you sound very invested."
Artemis pushed off the car and opened the door. "Investment isn't command."
Leto followed her in. "Keep telling yourself that."
As the engine turned over and they pulled back into traffic, Artemis felt it—a faint, unnameable awareness, like a line tightening somewhere just out of sight. Not danger. Not alarm.
Attention.
She didn't turn her head.
She didn't need to.
Artemis was looking at her phone when it happened.
Not walking blindly—just distracted enough to be human about it. The message from the younger Hunter was brief, efficient, and irritatingly vague. She slowed her steps near the curb, thumb hovering as she reread it, attention split between the screen and the crosswalk ahead.
Someone stepped into her path at the exact wrong moment.
They collided shoulder to shoulder—not hard enough to hurt, just enough to jolt. Artemis shifted instinctively, weight already correcting, irritation rising out of reflex more than intent.
"Sorry," the man said at the same time she did.
They both stopped.
That, too, was irritating.
Artemis looked up, already prepared to dismiss the interaction and move on. He had done the same—half-turned away, phone still in his hand, apology clearly habitual rather than apologetic.
Then their eyes met.
Nothing dramatic happened. No spark. No lightning. No sudden realization.
Just a pause that lasted a fraction longer than it needed to.
He frowned slightly, as if reassessing something he hadn't meant to notice. Artemis mirrored the expression without meaning to, irritation cooling into something more neutral. Curious, maybe. Annoyed at herself for being curious.
"Didn't see you," he said, tone easy, almost amused. Not defensive. Not flirtatious. Just… normal.
"Likewise," Artemis replied.
That should have been the end of it.
It wasn't.
He shifted his grip on the phone, glancing past her toward the crosswalk and then back, like he was deciding whether to continue or comment on the shared inconvenience. "Guess that's what I get for multitasking."
"Or standing in the middle of a sidewalk," Artemis said, dry without being sharp.
His mouth twitched. "Fair."
The light changed. People began to move around them, flowing past as if they were obstacles no one wanted to acknowledge. Neither of them stepped away immediately.
Leto watched from a few steps back, saying nothing.
"I'll, uh—" he gestured vaguely toward the street, then stopped himself. "You're not wrong, by the way."
Artemis raised an eyebrow. "About?"
"The sidewalk thing." He shrugged. "Occupational hazard."
"Of what?" she asked before deciding whether she cared.
He considered the question, then smirked. "Bad timing."
That earned him a look. Not hostile. Appraising.
"Right," Artemis said. "Well. Good luck with that."
"Yeah," he said, stepping aside to let her pass. "You too."
She walked on without looking back, phone slipping back into her pocket. The interaction faded as quickly as it had formed—unremarkable on the surface, forgettable by design.
And yet, three steps later, Artemis realized she'd slowed.
Not because she wanted to turn around.
But because, inexplicably, she was still thinking about the way he'd smiled like the moment hadn't mattered—while clearly registering that it had.
She straightened and kept walking.
It meant nothing.
Which was precisely why it bothered her that it didn't feel like nothing at all.
They should have separated.
That was the natural conclusion to the moment—two people colliding, apologizing, moving on. Artemis had already taken a step to do exactly that when he spoke again, not stopping her, not insisting, just… continuing.
"You know," he said, glancing at the crosswalk as people streamed past them, "if this were a movie, this is where dramatic music would kick in."
Artemis stopped despite herself.
She turned back slowly. "What kind of movie?"
He considered it, head tilting slightly. "Depends. Bollywood, probably. Lots of eye contact. Someone's mother would show up in the background for no reason."
That earned him a look—sharp, incredulous, but not unamused. "You bumped into me on a sidewalk."
"I did," he agreed easily. "Which is exactly how those start."
"That's not reassuring."
"Didn't mean it to be."
The corner of his mouth lifted, faint and unguarded, like he wasn't trying to impress her so much as entertain himself. Artemis noted that before she could stop herself, then immediately resented the fact that she'd noted it at all.
"You narrate accidents often?" she asked.
"Only the interesting ones."
"And this qualifies?"
He shrugged. "You stopped walking."
She opened her mouth to deny it, then closed it again. He wasn't wrong. That irritated her more than the joke.
"Careful," she said. "You're assigning meaning where there isn't any."
"Am I?" He glanced around at the city—people moving, cars idling, life resuming around them like they were temporarily irrelevant. "Feels like there's at least some meaning. Otherwise this would already be over."
Artemis crossed her arms. "Or you just don't know when to disengage."
"That too," he said cheerfully. "I've been told."
Leto, standing a few paces back, watched the exchange with quiet interest and said nothing.
The light changed again. A fresh wave of pedestrians pressed through, nudging the moment forward. Artemis felt the subtle pressure of choice—stay, go, justify neither.
"You're blocking traffic," she said, because it was true and because it gave her something solid to hold onto.
He stepped aside immediately, holding up his hands in surrender. "Fair point. I'll relocate my cinematic ambitions."
She moved past him, then hesitated just long enough to add, "For what it's worth, your movie would be terrible."
He laughed—not loud, not performative. "Most of them are."
She walked away after that, no dramatic exit, no backward glance. The city swallowed her up within seconds, the moment dissolving into heat and noise and motion.
Behind her, he stood where she'd left him for a heartbeat longer than necessary, watching nothing in particular with a faint, thoughtful expression.
Leto fell into step beside Artemis a few yards later.
"You didn't scowl," she observed mildly.
Artemis kept her eyes forward. "I didn't have reason to."
"Mm," Leto said. "Interesting."
Artemis didn't respond. She told herself the encounter was forgettable, which was why it bothered her—just slightly—that it didn't feel forgotten at all.
They walked for a block before Artemis realized she was still replaying the conversation.
Not the words themselves—those were unremarkable enough—but the ease of it. The way it hadn't demanded anything. The way it hadn't tried to become more than it was. That, she decided, was the problem. Ease had a way of slipping past defenses because it didn't announce itself as a threat.
She checked her phone again, grounding herself in the coordinates and the short status update waiting there. All accounted for. Waiting. Practical. Necessary. Real. She folded the device away and lengthened her stride, as if momentum could reset whatever had briefly gone off-course.
Leto matched her pace without comment.
After a few seconds, Artemis said, "That was nothing."
"Mmm," Leto replied.
Artemis shot her a look. "You're agreeing too easily."
"I'm acknowledging," Leto said. "There's a difference."
"There isn't," Artemis said.
"There is," Leto said calmly. "You just don't like it."
Artemis turned her attention back to the street. Cars rolled past. A delivery truck double-parked with its hazards on. Someone argued with a parking meter like it had personally offended them. The city kept going, indifferent to moments that didn't know they were moments.
"He talks too much," Artemis said, because it felt safer than saying anything else.
"He talked enough," Leto corrected. "You stayed."
"That doesn't mean—"
"It means exactly what it means," Leto said, not unkindly. "Nothing more. Nothing less."
Artemis frowned. "You're being deliberately vague."
"I'm letting you decide how much space it gets," Leto replied.
They reached the car again. Artemis unlocked it and slid into the seat, exhaling as the door shut. The interior felt smaller than it had earlier, as if the city had followed her inside.
She stared through the windshield for a second longer than necessary.
"I'm here for the Hunters," she said, firmly this time. "Not for… distractions."
"Of course," Leto said, starting the engine. "And you're very good at staying on task."
The words weren't teasing. They were factual. That somehow made them worse.
As they pulled back into traffic, Artemis felt the earlier ease recede, replaced by the familiar steadiness of purpose. This was better. This was where she belonged—decisions with edges, responsibilities with weight. Conversations that didn't matter had a way of complicating things.
And yet—
A faint, unwelcome thought surfaced: It didn't feel like a complication.
She pushed it aside before it could settle.
The car turned onto a quieter road, buildings thinning as they moved away from the city center. Artemis straightened, attention narrowing, the soft bubble of almost-comfort collapsing into something sharper.
Whatever had just happened—whatever almost happened—was irrelevant now.
She had somewhere to be.
And whatever waited for her there would not be gentle.
They drove in silence for a few minutes, the kind that wasn't uncomfortable so much as unfinished. Artemis watched the road narrow, storefronts giving way to longer stretches of asphalt and low buildings. The city thinned. The air felt heavier, less distracted.
She welcomed it.
Leto didn't interrupt right away. She never did when Artemis was still arranging things internally—stacking impressions, filing away what didn't belong. When she finally spoke, her tone was mild, almost conversational.
"You know," she said, eyes on the road, "you didn't correct him."
Artemis didn't look over. "About what?"
"Anything," Leto replied. "The movie. The timing. Himself."
"That wasn't my responsibility."
"No," Leto agreed. "It wasn't."
The pause stretched just long enough to invite a response. Artemis gave none.
Leto continued, carefully casual. "Once upon a time, you would've ended that exchange in three sentences."
Artemis folded her arms. "Once upon a time, I was in charge."
"And now?"
"And now I'm here to check on the Hunters," Artemis said, crisp. "Which is what I intend to do."
Leto's lips curved faintly. "You're very good at intentions."
Artemis turned to her then, expression cool. "Say what you want to say."
Leto met her gaze briefly, then returned her attention to the road. "I already did."
Artemis scoffed. "You implied something."
"I observed something," Leto corrected. "There's a difference."
"There really isn't."
"There is," Leto said. "You just don't like when I point it out."
The car slowed as they approached a turn. Artemis watched the signal blink, irritation surfacing—not at Leto, not at the conversation, but at the lingering echo of something she'd meant to discard.
"He didn't matter," Artemis said.
"I didn't say he did."
"You're thinking it."
Leto considered that. "I'm thinking you didn't dismiss him."
"That's not the same thing."
"No," Leto said. "It isn't."
The light changed. Leto turned onto the side road leading toward the coordinates Artemis had memorized. The surroundings grew quieter, more subdued. This was better. This was manageable.
Leto spoke once more, softly. "You don't have to explain it to me."
"I'm not explaining anything."
"I know," Leto said. "I'm just noting that you didn't harden."
Artemis stared ahead, jaw tightening. "I didn't soften either."
Leto smiled, small and unreadable. "That's why it stood out."
The road stretched on. Artemis felt the moment finally loosen its grip, slipping into the background where it belonged. She let it go without ceremony.
"Drop it," she said.
Leto inclined her head. "Already did."
They drove the rest of the way without another word, the earlier lightness dissolving into something quieter and more focused. Whatever that encounter had been—whatever it had almost become—was now firmly behind her.
Or so Artemis told herself as the coordinates drew closer, and the weight of responsibility settled back into place.
The location wasn't wrong.
That was the first thing Artemis registered as they pulled in. The coordinates matched. The buildings were the right kind of nondescript—rented, temporary, easy to abandon if needed. Vehicles were parked where they should be. On the surface, it looked like a functioning operation.
On the surface.
She stepped out of the car and felt it immediately—not danger, not threat, but strain. The air carried it, tight and contained, like a room where everyone had agreed not to speak about the same thing.
A couple of Hunters noticed her arrival and straightened out of habit, then stopped themselves. Artemis clocked the correction without comment. She didn't blame them. They'd been trained to respond to her presence for centuries. Undoing that kind of reflex took time.
"I'm not here to run anything," she said before anyone could say it for her. Her voice carried just enough to reach the small cluster forming nearby. "I'm here to check on you. That's all."
A beat passed. Then Zoe stepped forward.
She looked the same—composed, sharp-eyed, controlled—but the tension around her mouth hadn't been there the last time Artemis had seen her. That mattered.
"You didn't need to come," Zoe said, not unkindly.
"I know," Artemis replied. "That's why I'm not staying."
Zoe studied her for a second longer, then nodded once. "All right."
No challenge. No resentment. Just acceptance layered over something heavier. Artemis didn't like that weight, and she liked even less that she hadn't caused it—but she felt responsible for it anyway.
They moved inside. The space that should have been loud with movement and quiet chatter was subdued instead. Hunters sat too still. Conversations cut off when Artemis passed, not out of fear, but habit—and something else underneath it. Worry, tightly leashed.
A younger Hunter approached, tablet tucked under her arm. The same one who'd been sending the updates. She stopped short, unsure whether to salute, nod, or simply speak.
"Health check," Artemis said gently, saving her the choice. "You can start with the basics."
The Hunter nodded, relief flickering across her face, and launched into logistics—rotations, supplies, minor injuries. Everything she said was efficient. Everything she avoided was not.
Artemis listened without interrupting, eyes moving, cataloguing details she wasn't supposed to act on anymore. Bruises that hadn't been there before. Equipment left where it shouldn't have been. The absence of two familiar presences she had already noticed and not yet named.
Zoe fell into step beside her as they walked the perimeter. "They're holding together," she said quietly.
"That's not the same as being fine," Artemis replied.
Zoe didn't argue.
They stopped near the back of the building, away from the others. Artemis turned to face her fully. "I'm not here to issue corrections," she said. "And I won't interfere unless there's an immediate risk."
Zoe met her gaze, something unreadable passing behind her eyes. "Understood."
The word landed heavier than it should have.
Artemis looked past her, taking in the space again—the too-quiet rooms, the waiting that clung to everything. This wasn't routine. This wasn't stability.
Whatever had happened here, it had already begun to hollow the place out.
And she was only just arriving to see it.
It took Artemis less than five minutes to confirm what she already knew.
Nothing was actively wrong—and that was the problem.
The Hunters moved when spoken to. They answered questions. They followed routines that had clearly been maintained out of discipline rather than confidence. The place functioned, but without rhythm. Like a body still going through the motions after the shock had already passed.
Artemis stood near the center of the room and let her gaze settle, not on individuals but on the space between them. Empty chairs. Gear racks that weren't full. The subtle way conversations didn't resume once they stopped. This wasn't grief. Not yet.
This was waiting.
Zoe noticed her attention linger and exhaled slowly. "They haven't been sleeping much," she said, quietly enough that only Artemis could hear. "No nightmares. Just… restlessness."
"That's worse," Artemis replied.
Zoe's jaw tightened. "I know."
A Hunter laughed somewhere down the hall—too loud, too sudden. The sound cut off almost immediately, as if whoever had made it realized it didn't belong. Artemis didn't turn toward it. She didn't need to. Forced normalcy was always louder than the real thing.
"How long?" Artemis asked.
Zoe hesitated.
"That's not an answer," Artemis said gently.
"Three days," Zoe replied. "Since the ambush."
There it was.
The word didn't ripple through the room because everyone already carried it. Artemis felt it settle into place with unpleasant clarity. Three days was long enough for hope to fray, short enough for denial to still exist. The worst stretch of time there was.
"Were you moving locations?" Artemis asked.
"Yes," Zoe said. "Gas stations. Short stops. They were with the group until—" She stopped, recalibrating. "Until they weren't."
Artemis closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. Control first. Reaction later.
"They were taken," she said, not as a question.
Zoe nodded once.
No one else spoke. They didn't need to. The silence thickened, no longer just strained but weighted, pressing down on everyone in the room. Artemis felt eyes on her—not expectation of command, but something more fragile.
Permission.
She straightened slowly, making sure her posture didn't signal authority. That would have been easy. Habitual. Wrong.
"Has anyone been hurt since?" she asked.
"No," Zoe said. "Not physically."
Artemis absorbed that. Lily and Rose were gone. The rest were intact—for now. That meant whoever had taken them had been precise. Selective. This hadn't been chaos. It had been intention.
That was worse.
Artemis glanced around the room again, committing faces to memory. She met a few gazes and held them, not as a leader issuing reassurance, but as someone who refused to look away.
"I'm here to check on you," she said, voice steady. "So this is me checking."
The words landed quietly, but they anchored the space in a way nothing else had yet.
Zoe watched her closely, something unreadable in her expression.
The waiting didn't end.
But now, it had a name.
Zoe didn't start with names.
She started with sequence—because that was how she coped, and Artemis recognized it immediately. Events laid out cleanly, one after another, as if clarity could blunt the damage.
"They were running support," Zoe said, voice controlled, eyes fixed on a spot just past Artemis's shoulder. "Nothing frontline. Just logistics. Fuel, supplies. Short stops only."
Artemis nodded once. She didn't interrupt. Interruptions made people defensive, and Zoe didn't need that right now.
"We rotated locations every few hours," Zoe continued. "No patterns. No repeated stops. Lily was tracking routes. Rose was… complaining about the coffee."
The faintest ghost of a smile tried to surface and failed. Zoe inhaled, steadying herself.
"It was a gas station off the interstate," she said. "Middle of nowhere. Broad daylight. They were gone less than six minutes."
Artemis felt something tighten—not in her chest, but lower, steadier. Anger didn't flare. Panic didn't follow. This was information, and she treated it like information.
"Taken inside?" Artemis asked.
"No," Zoe said. "Outside. Parking lot. Two vehicles. Clean. Quiet. No weapons drawn that anyone saw."
That ruled out chaos. Ruled out impulse.
"They didn't fight," Zoe added quickly, the words coming faster now. "They didn't have time."
Artemis met her gaze. "That's not a failure."
Zoe's jaw clenched. "I know. But—"
"But you'll still carry it," Artemis finished.
Zoe exhaled, the breath shaking despite her control.
"They didn't leave anything behind," Zoe said. "No blood. No gear. Phones were gone. Everything suggests they were the objective."
Artemis looked past her, mind assembling the shape of it. Selective extraction. No collateral. No message. Someone had known who they were, where they'd be, and when to move.
That wasn't random violence.
"That's why we didn't scatter," Zoe continued. "We locked down. Waited. We didn't want to make it worse."
"That was the right call," Artemis said immediately.
Zoe blinked. "You're sure?"
"Yes."
The certainty in Artemis's voice surprised even her. She let it stand.
Silence settled again, heavier now that the truth had been spoken. Around them, the Hunters pretended not to listen, which meant they were listening to every word.
Artemis shifted her weight slightly, conscious of every signal she was sending. She was not here to command. She was not here to absolve. But she could do this much.
"Lily and Rose are capable," she said. "And they were taken alive."
Zoe's eyes flickered. "You don't know that."
"No," Artemis agreed. "But everything you've described points that way."
That mattered.
Zoe looked away, jaw working. "We don't know where they are."
Artemis nodded slowly. "Not yet."
The word carried more weight than reassurance. It wasn't a promise. It was a statement of intent.
For the first time since Artemis had arrived, the waiting in the room shifted—not easing, not lifting, but changing shape.
And that was when Zoe's gaze sharpened, something cautious and questioning entering her expression.
Because she understood exactly what that word implied.
And she wasn't sure Artemis was allowed to mean it.
Zoe spoke before Artemis could.
"No."
The word wasn't loud. It wasn't sharp. It was firm in the way that came from long habit and longer responsibility. The kind that didn't need volume to hold its ground.
Artemis turned to her slowly.
"You're not in command," Zoe continued, voice steady, eyes clear. "You know that. And even if you were—this isn't something you shoulder alone."
"I know what I'm allowed to do," Artemis said.
"That's not what I'm talking about."
Zoe gestured toward the room—not dramatically, just enough to encompass the Hunters pretending very hard not to listen. "They're already on edge. If you step in now, if you start moving pieces, they'll read it as panic. Or worse—permission to break formation."
Artemis absorbed that without flinching. Zoe was right. Which was exactly why she'd spoken when she did.
"I'm not stepping in," Artemis said evenly. "And I'm not issuing orders."
Zoe frowned. "Then what are you—"
"I'm taking responsibility," Artemis said, cutting in—not sharply, but decisively. "Not as your commander. As myself."
The distinction landed like a line drawn on the floor.
Zoe stared at her. "That's not how this works."
"It is now," Artemis replied. "Because I'm not acting as Artemis of the Hunt. I'm acting as a mortal with a vested interest in two missing people."
Zoe's eyes narrowed. "You're still banned."
"Yes," Artemis said. "From running you. From commanding you. Not from caring."
"That's a dangerous loophole."
Artemis inclined her head slightly. "I'm aware."
Zoe took a breath, visibly weighing her response. "If you do this," she said carefully, "you do it without us. No resources. No backup. No expectation of intervention."
"I wouldn't ask for any of that," Artemis replied.
"And if it goes wrong?"
"Then it goes wrong for me alone."
The room felt very quiet.
Zoe studied Artemis's face, searching for something—hesitation, defiance, pride. She found none of it. What she saw instead unsettled her more.
Resolve, stripped of authority.
"You're serious," Zoe said.
"Yes."
Zoe exhaled slowly, hand coming up to rub at her temple. "You always pick the worst timing."
Artemis's expression softened just a fraction. "You taught me to."
That earned her a short, humorless huff.
Zoe dropped her hand. "I don't like this."
"You don't have to."
"I don't trust that you won't get hurt."
Artemis met her gaze fully. "That's the risk of being human."
The words hung between them, heavier than Artemis had expected. Zoe looked away first.
"Fine," Zoe said at last. "You do whatever you're going to do. But you don't pull us into it."
"I won't," Artemis promised.
Zoe nodded once, sharp and final. "Then I'll keep them together. Calm. Alive."
Artemis held her gaze for a second longer, then inclined her head in acknowledgment. Not command. Respect.
As she turned away, she felt it settle—not anger, not urgency, but something colder and clearer.
She was not in charge.
Which meant there was nothing stopping her from acting alone.
And for the first time since Lily and Rose's names had been spoken aloud, Artemis knew exactly what she was going to do next.
Time Skip: West Bengal India [Just after events of chapter 14: Revalations]
The house was too quiet.
Not empty—never empty—but subdued in a way Naruto hadn't noticed before. Or maybe he had noticed it and simply hadn't known what to call it yet. He sat at the dining table with a cup of tea he'd already forgotten to drink, watching the steam curl and vanish like it was trying to tell him something he didn't feel ready to hear.
Srishti was in the other room, humming softly to herself as she reorganized a shelf that didn't need reorganizing. She did that when she was nervous. Or bored. Or pretending not to think too hard about things that hovered just out of reach.
Naruto leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.
Post-Revelations had done that to him—left things hanging without giving him the courtesy of answers. Power, identity, responsibility. All of it had been dragged into the light and then abandoned there, unresolved. He knew what he could do. He knew what he had done. What he didn't know was how much of his life was still his own.
He rubbed a hand over his face, exhaling slowly.
"Stop brooding," Srishti called from the other room without looking up. "You're doing the thing."
Naruto smirked faintly. "I don't brood."
"You brood," she replied immediately. "You just call it thinking so it feels productive."
He laughed under his breath. She wasn't wrong.
"I was just wondering," he said, standing and joining her by the shelf, "when exactly I became the guy who drinks tea and stares into space."
"You always did that," she said. "You just used to do it after punching something."
"Growth," Naruto said solemnly.
Srishti rolled her eyes, but the smile she gave him didn't quite reach them. She nudged a book into place, then another, movements precise. "You're restless," she said.
"Maybe."
"Something's coming," she added, quieter.
Naruto didn't answer immediately. He didn't need to. That feeling had been sitting in his chest all morning, low and insistent. Not dread. Not excitement. Just the certainty that whatever calm existed right now was borrowed time.
He looked at her—really looked this time. She'd grown used to his silences, learned how to live around them without demanding explanations. That fact sat heavier on him than any revelation ever had.
"Hey," he said suddenly. "If I told you we might need to take a short trip soon—no details yet—would you trust me?"
Srishti froze, hand still on the shelf.
She turned slowly. "That depends," she said. "Is this one of your normal trips or one of your 'don't ask questions' trips?"
Naruto huffed a breath. "I was hoping for the first one."
She studied his face for a long moment, then sighed. "You're bad at lying when you're tired."
"Good thing I'm not lying."
"Yet," she said.
The words settled between them, heavy but familiar.
Before Naruto could respond, the doorbell rang.
Once.
Twice.
Three times—precise, measured.
Naruto's posture shifted immediately. Whatever he'd been about to say vanished, replaced by something colder and sharper. He glanced at the door, then back at Srishti.
"Stay here," he said.
She nodded without argument.
As Naruto moved toward the door, the quiet in the house changed—not broken, just redirected. He knew that sound. The sound of personal time ending.
And when he opened the door to find the faces waiting for him, he understood exactly why the morning had felt like borrowed time.

Event 13 — The State Is Bleeding
(~450 words)
They didn't waste time with pleasantries.
Naruto barely had the door shut before the weight of the room shifted, his home turning into something else entirely. The IB chief stood closest, posture stiff, expression carved into neutrality. The RAW chief lingered half a step behind, eyes sharp, already measuring. The Eastern Command General filled the remaining space without trying to—presence doing the work for him.
Srishti hovered at the edge of the hallway, silent and alert.
"We'll be direct," the IB chief said. "We don't have the luxury not to be."
Naruto nodded once and gestured toward the table. "Then sit."
They did.
Files came out. A tablet lit up. Images scrolled past—maps, names, redacted blocks stacked on top of one another like scars. Naruto didn't comment. He watched. Listened.
"The IC-81B attacks didn't just cost lives," the RAW chief said. "They burned networks. Assets. Trust."
"Most of our external field agents are compromised," the IB chief continued. "Names. Locations. Families. Some of them didn't even know they were exposed until it was too late."
Naruto's jaw tightened, but he said nothing.
"We traced the leak to a sleeper," the RAW chief said. "Embedded. Deep. Acting under our flag."
A pause. Then, quieter: "ISI."
Srishti's fingers curled slightly at her side. Naruto felt it, but didn't look back.
"The man extracted a data chip before we could contain him," the IB chief went on. "Operational routes. Dead drops. Future mission outlines. Enough to keep them three steps ahead of us for years."
Naruto leaned forward, forearms resting on the table. "And you can't retrieve it."
"We can," the Eastern Command General said at last, voice steady. "But not cleanly. And not with anyone whose identity is already compromised."
The word settled heavily between them.
"All standard field operatives are off the table," the RAW chief said. "Every single one. The moment they move, they light up."
Naruto exhaled slowly. "So you're out of options."
"We're out of safe options," the IB chief corrected.
The General's gaze fixed on Naruto then, direct and unflinching. "Except one."
Naruto didn't react. He already knew where this was going. He'd known the moment they'd crossed his threshold.
"You," the General said. "Your record. Your commendations. Your status as an honorary award holder."
"You mean I don't officially exist where it matters," Naruto said.
The General inclined his head. "Precisely."
Srishti took a step forward. "You're asking him to walk into something you can't even map."
"We're asking him to do what no one else can," the IB chief said quietly.
Naruto's gaze flicked to her, sharp but controlled. "They're not asking. They're bleeding."
Silence followed. No one contradicted him.
The RAW chief broke it. "The sleeper is currently operating out of Turkey."
That got Naruto's attention.
"Turkey," he repeated.
"Yes," the IB chief said. "And if we don't move fast, he disappears. Along with the chip."
Naruto leaned back, eyes narrowing—not in fear, not in hesitation, but calculation. He could feel the shape of the problem now. Its edges. Its cost.
"This isn't a retrieval," he said finally. "It's containment."
The General nodded once. "At minimum."
Naruto closed his eyes for a brief second, then opened them again.
"Then let's stop pretending this is optional," he said. "And talk about terms."
The room went very still.
Because they all understood what that meant.
And because, for the first time since they'd arrived, the bleeding had found something sharp enough to press back.
14
Event 14 — No One Clean Left
(~450 words)
The RAW chief didn't argue.
He simply slid the tablet across the table and let the data speak for itself.
Names blurred past in organized columns—agents, assets, handlers. Green tags turned yellow, yellow turned red. Entire sections collapsed into blocks marked compromised. Naruto watched it with the same stillness he'd learned on battlefields: no reaction wasted, no emotion given air until it was useful.
"This isn't a localized breach," the IB chief said. "It's systemic. Every active operative outside the country is burned to some degree."
Naruto's gaze flicked to Srishti, then back to the screen. "What about internal movement?"
"Tracked," the RAW chief replied. "Flagged within hours. Sometimes minutes."
"And contractors?"
"Known," the Eastern Command General said. "Or predictable."
Naruto leaned back, fingers interlaced. "So anyone you send either lights up immediately or walks straight into a trap."
"Yes."
"And you're still calling this a mission," Naruto said mildly.
The IB chief met his eyes. "We're calling it survival."
Silence settled, thick but not tense. This wasn't a negotiation yet. It was an autopsy.
"What about honorary holders?" Naruto asked.
The RAW chief hesitated—just long enough to matter.
Naruto's eyes sharpened. "You wouldn't have brought that up unless you'd already checked."
"We have," the IB chief admitted. "Your name is on the list. Along with a handful of others."
"And the others?"
"Too visible," the RAW chief said. "Too old. Or too politically expensive."
Naruto let out a short breath, something close to a laugh. "So I'm the least inconvenient."
The Eastern Command General shook his head. "You're the least traceable."
That landed harder.
Srishti stepped forward again, voice tight. "You're asking him to disappear."
"We're asking him to move where no one is looking for him," the IB chief corrected. "And where no one will believe he belongs."
Naruto looked at her then, really looked—took in the tension she was holding, the way her shoulders had squared like she was bracing for impact. He turned back to the table.
"And if this goes wrong," he said, "you won't be able to pull me out."
"No," the General said. "We won't."
Naruto nodded slowly. He'd expected that answer. It didn't make it easier, but it made it honest.
"You've already lost control of the board," Naruto said. "You're asking me to play without telling me the rules."
"We don't know them anymore," the RAW chief said. "That's the problem."
Naruto's jaw tightened, not in anger but recognition. This wasn't incompetence. This was collapse—the kind that forced bad decisions because there were no good ones left.
He stood, pushing his chair back slightly. The movement drew every eye in the room.
"Then understand this," he said calmly. "If I do this, I don't do it as an asset. I don't answer to panic. And I don't move without protection for the people I leave behind."
The IB chief nodded immediately. "Name it."
Naruto's gaze flicked once more to Srishti.
"Oh, I will," he said.
And for the first time since the meeting had begun, the men across the table looked less relieved—and more wary.
Naruto didn't sit back down.
He stayed standing, one hand resting lightly on the back of the chair, posture relaxed in a way that made it very clear this was no longer their briefing—it was his.
"If I'm doing this," he said, voice even, "I'm doing it clean."
The IB chief nodded once. "Define clean."
Naruto didn't hesitate. "Five passports. Different nationalities. All untraceable. All valid."
The RAW chief's brow twitched. "Five?"
"I don't intend to announce which one I'm using," Naruto replied. "And I don't intend to be predictable."
The Eastern Command General studied him for a moment, then gave a short nod. "Continue."
"One credit card," Naruto went on. "Black. No name. No spending limit. Whatever shows up on it gets billed to the Indian government."
"That's a lot of trust," the IB chief said carefully.
Naruto met his gaze without blinking. "You're already asking for more."
Silence followed. Not objection—calculation.
"And oversight?" the RAW chief asked.
"No live tracking," Naruto said immediately. "No handlers on the ground. No 'check-ins' that compromise position. You get updates when I choose to give them."
The RAW chief's lips thinned. "You're asking us to let you disappear."
Naruto shrugged slightly. "You already said that's the only way this works."
The Eastern Command General broke in. "What about rules of engagement?"
Naruto's expression didn't change. "I neutralize the sleeper. I secure the chip. Anything beyond that depends on what I find."
"That's vague," the IB chief said.
"That's intentional."
Srishti shifted beside the doorway. Naruto felt it without looking.
"And if you don't come back?" she asked quietly.
Naruto turned to her then. The room seemed to recede slightly, as if recognizing the boundary between personal and professional and choosing—wisely—not to cross it.
"I will," he said. Not bravado. Not reassurance. Just certainty.
She searched his face, then nodded once, sharp and contained.
The IB chief cleared his throat. "There's one more thing."
Naruto's attention snapped back to him. "Say it."
"The sleeper is operating out of Turkey," the man said. "But he's not alone."
Naruto's eyes narrowed. "Go on."
"He's built a civilian cover," the RAW chief added. "Family. Residence. Mobility."
Naruto absorbed that. "A shield."
"Yes."
The Eastern Command General folded his hands. "Which complicates things."
Naruto considered it for half a second, then nodded. "Everything does."
He straightened fully now, decision settled.
"You'll have my answer by tonight," he said. "But don't mistake that for hesitation."
The IB chief met his gaze. "Then what is it?"
Naruto's mouth curved faintly, humorless. "Preparation."
He turned toward the hallway, already moving on to the next problem.
Behind him, the men exchanged looks—some relieved, some uneasy.
Because they had just handed their last clean move to someone who did not intend to play gently.
And because all of them knew: once Naruto stepped into this, there would be no way to pretend it was still under control.
Naruto didn't sleep that night.
Not because he couldn't, but because there was no point pretending rest would change anything. He sat at the edge of the bed, elbows braced on his knees, the house quiet around him in the way it always was before something irreversible. Decisions like this didn't arrive with urgency—they arrived with clarity.
By the time morning came, the answer had already settled.
He stood in the doorway as the IB chief spoke into his phone, voice low and precise. Whatever confirmation was being relayed on the other end didn't surprise Naruto. He'd known they would agree. They didn't have the luxury of refusal.
"It's done," the IB chief said, ending the call. "Your terms are accepted."
Naruto nodded once. "Good."
The RAW chief slid a sealed envelope across the table. "Documentation will be staggered. You'll receive them over the next forty-eight hours."
"I won't need that long," Naruto replied.
The Eastern Command General studied him closely. "You're committing before you've seen the full intel."
Naruto met his gaze. "You showed me enough."
Srishti stood near the doorway, arms crossed, eyes sharp. "You didn't even pretend to debate this."
Naruto glanced at her, expression softening just a fraction. "There was never a debate."
That didn't make her feel better. He knew it wouldn't.
"This isn't a deployment," the IB chief said. "There will be no extraction team."
Naruto nodded. "I'm aware."
"And if the situation escalates beyond retrieval?"
"Then it escalates," Naruto said simply. "I adapt."
The RAW chief hesitated. "There's another complication."
Naruto raised an eyebrow. "There's always another complication."
"The sleeper has moved frequently," the man continued. "But all confirmed sightings point to Turkey as a transit hub."
"I know," Naruto said. "That's why you came to me."
The IB chief watched him for a long moment. "You're certain?"
Naruto didn't answer immediately. He looked past them, toward the hallway where Srishti stood, pretending she wasn't listening while listening to everything.
"Yes," he said finally. "I'll take the mission."
The words didn't carry weight because they didn't need to. They were a statement of fact.
Srishti closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. "Then we need to talk."
Naruto inclined his head. "We will."
Not now. Not here. Not in front of them.
The Eastern Command General stood, offering his hand. Naruto took it, grip firm, brief.
"You're doing the country a service," the General said.
Naruto released his hand. "I'm preventing further damage."
The difference mattered.
As the men gathered their things and prepared to leave, Naruto felt the finality settle—not heavy, not dramatic, just present. This was no longer theoretical. The board had shifted. The move had been made.
When the door finally closed behind them, the house returned to its earlier quiet.
Naruto turned to Srishti.
"Pack a bag," he said. "We're taking a drive."
She stared at him. "That's it? That's your explanation?"
"It's the beginning of one," Naruto replied.
And for the first time since the meeting began, the mission felt real—not because of Turkey, or the chip, or the sleeper.
But because it had just reached the one person Naruto would not leave unprotected.
USA, [Around Same time]
Zoe didn't follow Artemis when she stepped outside.
That, in itself, was an answer.
The sun was lower now, casting long shadows across the lot. The noise from inside dulled behind the door, replaced by the faint hum of traffic somewhere beyond the buildings. Artemis stood still for a moment, letting the quiet settle—not to reflect, but to give Zoe the space she clearly needed.
It didn't last.
"You're serious," Zoe said from behind her.
Artemis turned. Zoe stood a few steps away, arms folded, expression tight—not angry, but braced. This wasn't confrontation. It was concern sharpened by experience.
"Yes," Artemis said.
Zoe exhaled slowly. "You're banned. You know that. Even being here is… already a concession."
"I'm aware," Artemis replied. "Which is why I'm not staying."
"That's not what I meant," Zoe said. "You don't get to decide this on your own anymore."
Artemis studied her face—really studied it. Zoe wasn't challenging her authority. She was questioning her judgment. That was new. And fair.
"I'm not deciding anything for you," Artemis said calmly. "I'm deciding what I do next."
Zoe shook her head. "You say that like it's different."
"It is," Artemis said. "Because I won't involve you. Or them."
"And if you fail?"
"Then you keep them together," Artemis replied. "And alive. Like you've already been doing."
Zoe's jaw tightened. "You always talk like this right before something goes wrong."
Artemis didn't deny it. "You're doubting me."
Zoe hesitated, then nodded once. "Yes."
The honesty hit harder than accusation would have.
"Good," Artemis said. "You should."
Zoe frowned. "That's not comforting."
"It's not meant to be," Artemis replied. "Blind trust would be worse."
They stood there in the late afternoon light, the distance between them no longer physical but ideological. Artemis felt it clearly now—the line that separated who she had been from who she was allowed to be.
"You don't have divine reach anymore," Zoe said quietly. "No Hunters at your back. No authority to pull strings."
Artemis met her gaze without flinching. "Exactly."
Zoe's expression sharpened. "Then what do you think you have?"
Artemis answered without hesitation.
"I'm human," she said. "And right now, that's my best quality."
The words weren't dramatic. They didn't need to be. They simply fit.
Zoe stared at her for a long moment, searching for defiance, pride, desperation—anything that would let her argue. She found none of it.
"You'll get hurt," Zoe said finally.
"Yes," Artemis agreed. "That's a possibility."
Zoe looked away, lips pressed thin. "I don't like this."
"I know."
Silence stretched between them, not hostile, just heavy.
When Zoe spoke again, her voice was quieter. "Then don't make it worse for them."
"I won't," Artemis promised.
Zoe nodded once—sharp, final. "Then do it alone."
Artemis inclined her head. Not command. Acceptance.
As she turned back toward the car, the distance between them remained—but it was no longer uncertain.
It was defined.
And that, Artemis knew, was the only way this could work.
Artemis didn't announce what she was doing.
She simply started.
No council. No formal declaration. No invocation of authority she no longer held. She borrowed a quiet corner of the space, set her bag down, and began to work with the kind of method that didn't draw attention because it didn't need to.
A laptop came out. A notebook. Two phones—one hers, one borrowed. She moved through them with practiced efficiency, posture relaxed, expression neutral. To anyone watching, it looked mundane. Clerical, even.
That was the point.
She started with the smallest things. Time stamps. Fuel receipts. The gaps between them. The stations that should have been random but clustered just enough to matter. She cross-referenced locations against traffic cams, delivery routes, private transport permits. No divine insight. No shortcuts. Just patience.
Leto watched from a distance, saying nothing.
Artemis traced patterns the way she used to trace constellations—not searching for destiny, but for repetition. Where routes bent. Where they narrowed. Where they made sense for someone who wanted to move people quietly, efficiently, and without attracting attention.
"This wasn't opportunistic," she said finally, more to herself than anyone else. "It was scheduled."
Leto stepped closer. "You're certain?"
"Yes," Artemis replied. "Look at the timing. They weren't followed—they were expected."
She pulled up a secondary map, overlaying logistics routes she shouldn't have known about but now did. Cargo hubs. Freight companies with opaque ownership. Border-adjacent transfers that never quite crossed official thresholds.
"This is a pipeline," Artemis said. "Not a grab."
Leto's expression sharpened. "Human trafficking."
"Yes," Artemis said. "But not for resale. For transport."
She followed the line eastward, watching it slip across borders with alarming ease. Pakistan. The Middle East. Stops that existed more on paper than in reality. Each point narrowed the possibilities further.
Artemis leaned back slightly, rubbing at her temple—not from strain, but from recognition. "They didn't take Lily and Rose because they were vulnerable," she said. "They took them because they fit."
Leto folded her arms. "Fit what?"
"A profile," Artemis replied. "Young. Capable. Mobile. Not high-profile enough to trigger immediate retaliation."
Leto studied the screen. "And you?"
Artemis met her gaze. "I don't fit."
Not anymore.
She tapped a final point on the map. The route converged there, threads tightening into something undeniable.
"Turkey," she said.
The word settled between them, heavy with implication.
Leto exhaled slowly. "You're moving fast."
"I have to," Artemis replied. "Because this won't stay small."
She began shutting things down, wiping traces, clearing caches. Mortal precautions. Mortal methods. No thunder. No spectacle.
Just work.
As she packed the last device away, Artemis felt the weight of it—not fear, not excitement, but focus. This was what she could do now. This was where she was effective.
"I told Zoe I'd do it alone," she said.
Leto picked up the bag and slung it over her shoulder. "And yet."
Artemis glanced at her.
Leto met her eyes, calm and steady. "I'm not a Hunter."
Artemis considered that, then nodded once.
They moved toward the exit together, no longer bound by rank or rule—just intent.
Whatever waited in Turkey wasn't divine.
And that, Artemis knew with quiet certainty, was exactly why she could reach it.
They were already moving when the last piece clicked into place.
Airports blurred into one another the way they always did when travel stopped being about destination and became about momentum. Artemis sat by the window, laptop closed, eyes on the darkening sky outside. She wasn't working anymore—not actively. The work had already narrowed itself down to something smaller, sharper.
Leto's phone vibrated softly between them.
She checked it once, then again, expression shifting from neutral to intent. "That's new."
Artemis didn't look over. "Talk."
"They weren't held long," Leto said. "Not in one place."
Artemis turned then. "Explain."
Leto scrolled, then angled the screen just enough. "The ring doesn't warehouse. It transfers. Short windows. Clean handoffs. Lily and Rose were moved within hours."
Artemis absorbed that, her mind adjusting course without resistance. "So there was never meant to be a rescue window."
"No," Leto said. "Only an interception window."
That mattered. It meant this wasn't about finding a location—it was about disrupting a route.
Artemis leaned forward, forearms resting on her knees, attention sharpening. "Where do the transfers converge?"
Leto didn't answer immediately. She brought up another map, layered with routes Artemis had already traced. Cargo flights. Commercial ferries. Private charters that never quite registered as private. The lines narrowed the closer they got to Europe, funneling into fewer and fewer points.
"One coordinator," Leto said. "Same signature across multiple extractions."
"Describe him."
Leto glanced at the file. "Indian-looking. Long black hair. Full beard. Operates through intermediaries."
Artemis's jaw tightened—not in recognition, but focus. "Not local."
"No," Leto agreed. "But comfortable passing as such."
Artemis nodded slowly. "That's why the route works. He doesn't stand out."
"And he doesn't stay," Leto added. "He hands off before exposure."
Artemis closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. "Then Turkey isn't a base."
"It's an exit," Leto said.
The word settled, precise and final.
Artemis exhaled through her nose. "Which means Lily and Rose won't be there long."
"No," Leto said. "But he will be."
Artemis straightened, decision already forming. "Then we don't chase the girls. We catch the hand that moves them."
Leto studied her for a moment, then nodded. "You're thinking like a mortal."
"I am one," Artemis replied. "And mortals don't have the luxury of waiting."
The plane began its descent, lights flickering against the clouds. Artemis glanced out at the darkened horizon, feeling no sense of destiny, no pull—just alignment. Pieces settling where they belonged.
Somewhere ahead, a man with an unremarkable face and a carefully chosen disguise was preparing his next move.
He didn't know she was coming.
And Artemis intended to keep it that way.
Somewhere around Himachal Pradesh, India
The road into Himachal Pradesh narrowed as it climbed, concrete giving way to broken asphalt and long stretches where the mountain dictated the path. Pine trees crowded close, their shadows stretching across the windshield as the sun dipped lower. Srishti watched it all in silence, arms folded, gaze fixed firmly outside.
She hadn't spoken much since they'd left.
Naruto let the quiet sit. He'd learned the difference between silence that needed filling and silence that needed respect. This was the latter.
"You think I'm getting rid of you," Srishti said suddenly.
Naruto didn't answer right away. He slowed the car slightly, letting a truck pass before responding. "I think you think that," he said carefully.
"That's not a denial."
"It's not," Naruto agreed. "But it's not the truth either."
She scoffed softly. "You don't take people on road trips before disappearing."
"I do," Naruto said. "When I don't want them in the line of fire."
That earned him a sharp look. "So there is a line of fire."
Naruto kept his eyes on the road. "There's always one. This just happens to be closer."
The Gurukul came into view an hour later—stone and wood tucked into the mountain like it had always belonged there. Calm on the surface. Quiet in the way places designed for discipline always were. Too quiet.
They were met at the gate by the head instructor, expression serene, posture practiced. He smiled the kind of smile meant to reassure.
Naruto didn't return it.
"This isn't a visit," Naruto said, stepping out of the car. "And it isn't a request."
The man blinked. "I beg your—"
"If she comes out of this," Naruto continued, voice even, "confused, broken, indoctrinated, or turned into something you think belongs to you—"
Srishti's breath caught.
"I will come back," Naruto said. "And I will kill everyone responsible. I don't care who you worship. I don't care what you call your discipline. I don't care how ancient you think this place is."
The instructor's smile faltered.
"This is not a threat," Naruto added calmly. "It's a boundary."
Silence pressed in, heavy and absolute.
Srishti stared at him, shock warring with something else—understanding, maybe. Fear, definitely. But not of him.
The instructor swallowed. "She will be safe."
Naruto stepped closer, just enough to make the promise insufficient. "She will be untouched."
A beat.
"Yes," the man said. "Of course."
Naruto turned to Srishti then. "This is temporary," he said quietly. "I'll come back."
She searched his face, eyes shining with unshed words. "You better."
Naruto gave a faint smile. "I always do."
He watched as she was led inside, shoulders squared despite everything. When the doors closed behind her, the mountain felt suddenly heavier.
Naruto returned to the car without looking back.
Turkey waited.
And whatever was waiting for him there had just been warned—whether it knew it or not—that some lines, once drawn, were not crossed twice.
The distance between them was measured in hours, borders, and information.
Artemis learned first.
It came through a secondary channel—nothing official, nothing clean. A pattern confirmed by three unrelated sources, none of which knew about the others. She stood near the departure gate as Leto relayed it, voice low, precise.
"The coordinator isn't local," Leto said. "He blends. Indian-looking. Long black hair. Beard. Uses intermediaries so no one ever sees him stay."
Artemis absorbed the description without reaction. It fit the routes. It fit the discipline of the extraction. A man who could pass, move, vanish. Not a god. Not a monster.
Just effective.
"He doesn't escort them the whole way," Leto continued. "He hands off near Turkey. That's where the exit tightens."
"So Turkey is the choke point," Artemis said.
"Yes."
Artemis nodded once, decision settling fully now. "Then that's where he makes mistakes."
She didn't ask for a name. Names could wait. Profiles mattered more. Somewhere ahead, a man existed who thought himself invisible because he understood systems.
She had spent centuries dismantling systems.
On a different flight path, Naruto learned something else entirely.
The briefing came mid-transit, delivered in fragments as signals allowed. He stood near a window, phone pressed to his ear, eyes unfocused on the blur of runway lights beyond the glass.
"The sleeper maintains a civilian cover," the voice said. "Family unit. Mobile."
Naruto closed his eyes briefly. "Define family."
A pause. Then, carefully: "A daughter."
Naruto stilled.
"Age?"
"Close to yours," the voice continued. "Red hair. Kept out of direct exposure. Used as a stabilizing presence."
Naruto's grip tightened slightly—not in anger, not in hesitation, but recognition. Not of the girl herself, but of the tactic. Of the shape of the lie that made men feel human enough to justify anything.
"And the man?" Naruto asked.
Another pause. "Details are… inconsistent."
Naruto didn't push. He didn't need them yet.
The call ended. The terminal announcement rolled overhead. Boarding began.
Naruto pocketed the phone and exhaled slowly, letting the information settle without judgment. Somewhere ahead was a man who hid behind routine, behind family, behind the belief that systems protected those who understood them.
Naruto adjusted his jacket and stepped into line.
Elsewhere, Artemis did the same.
They were moving toward the same country with different pieces of the same truth—each unaware of the other's proximity, each convinced they were hunting something separate.
They weren't.
And when those truths finally collided, there would be no clean lines left to hide behind.
Only people.
